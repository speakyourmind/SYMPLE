my father s family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my
infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
than pip so i called myself pip and came to be called pip 
i give pirrip as my father s family name on the authority of his
tombstone and my sister mrs joe gargery who married the blacksmith 
as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness
of either of them for their days were long before the days of
photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones the shape of the letters on
my father s gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man 
with curly black hair from the character and turn of the inscription 
 also georgiana wife of the above i drew a childish conclusion that
my mother was freckled and sickly to five little stone lozenges each
about a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside
their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
mine who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in
that universal struggle i am indebted for a belief i religiously
entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands
in their trousers pockets and had never taken them out in this state of
existence 
ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river
wound twenty miles of the sea my first most vivid and broad impression
of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable
raw afternoon towards evening at such a time i found out for certain
that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and
that philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the
above were dead and buried and that alexander bartholomew abraham 
tobias and roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead
and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard 
intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle
feeding on it was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond
was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was
rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid
of it all and beginning to cry was pip 
 hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch keep still you
little devil or i ll cut your throat 
a fearful man all in coarse gray with a great iron on his leg a man
with no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his
head a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and
lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by
briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose
teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin 
 oh don t cut my throat sir i pleaded in terror pray don t do it 
sir 
 tell us your name said the man quick 
 pip sir 
 once more said the man staring at me give it mouth 
 pip pip sir 
 show us where you live said the man pint out the place 
i pointed to where our village lay on the flat in shore among the
alder trees and pollards a mile or more from the church 
the man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and
emptied my pockets there was nothing in them but a piece of bread when
the church came to itself for he was so sudden and strong that he
made it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my
feet when the church came to itself i say i was seated on a high
tombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously 
 you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you
ha got 
i believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my
years and not strong 
 darn me if i couldn t eat em said the man with a threatening shake
of his head and if i han t half a mind to t 
i earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn t and held tighter to
the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it 
partly to keep myself from crying 
 now lookee here said the man where s your mother 
 there sir said i 
he started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder 
 there sir i timidly explained also georgiana that s my mother 
 oh said he coming back and is that your father alonger your
mother 
 yes sir said i him too late of this parish 
 ha he muttered then considering who d ye live with supposin 
you re kindly let to live which i han t made up my mind about 
 my sister sir mrs joe gargery wife of joe gargery the
blacksmith sir 
 blacksmith eh said he and looked down at his leg 
after darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer
to my tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he
could hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine 
and mine looked most helplessly up into his 
 now lookee here he said the question being whether you re to be let
to live you know what a file is 
 yes sir 
 and you know what wittles is 
 yes sir 
after each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a
greater sense of helplessness and danger 
 you get me a file he tilted me again and you get me wittles he
tilted me again you bring em both to me he tilted me again or
i ll have your heart and liver out he tilted me again 
i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both
hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright 
sir perhaps i shouldn t be sick and perhaps i could attend more 
he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock then he held me by the arms in an upright
position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms 
 you bring me to morrow morning early that file and them wittles you
bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder you do it and you
never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having
seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to
live you fail or you go from my words in any partickler no matter how
small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted 
and ate now i ain t alone as you may think i am there s a young man
hid with me in comparison with which young man i am a angel that young
man hears the words i speak that young man has a secret way pecooliar
to himself of getting at a boy and at his heart and at his liver it
is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man a
boy may lock his door may be warm in bed may tuck himself up may draw
the clothes over his head may think himself comfortable and safe but
that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him
open i am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present
moment with great difficulty i find it wery hard to hold that young
man off of your inside now what do you say 
i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken
bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in
the morning 
 say lord strike you dead if you don t said the man 
i said so and he took me down 
 now he pursued you remember what you ve undertook and you remember
that young man and you get home 
 goo good night sir i faltered 
 much of that said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat i
wish i was a frog or a eel 
at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his
arms clasping himself as if to hold himself together and limped
towards the low church wall as i saw him go picking his way among the
nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked
in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people 
stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his
ankle and pull him in 
when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose
legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me when i
saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of
my legs but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on
again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking
his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the
marshes here and there for stepping places when the rains were heavy or
the tide was in 
the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped
to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not
nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed on the edge of the
river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon
by which the sailors steered like an unhooped cask upon a pole an
ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate the man was limping on
towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come
down and going back to hook himself up again it gave me a terrible
turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to
gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too i looked all
round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him but now
i was frightened again and ran home without stopping 
my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i 
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors
because she had brought me up by hand having at that time to find out
for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and
heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as
well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up
by hand 
she was not a good looking woman my sister and i had a general
impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand joe
was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed
to have somehow got mixed with their own whites he was a mild 
good natured sweet tempered easy going foolish dear fellow a sort
of hercules in strength and also in weakness 
my sister mrs joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing
redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she washed herself with a nutmeg grater instead of soap she was tall
and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her
figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in
front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful
merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this
apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it
at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it
off every day of her life 
joe s forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the
dwellings in our country were most of them at that time when i ran
home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting
alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellow sufferers and having
confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i
raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it 
sitting in the chimney corner 
 mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and she s
out now making it a baker s dozen 
 is she 
 yes pip said joe and what s worse she s got tickler with her 
at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler
was a wax ended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame 
 she sot down said joe and she got up and she made a grab at
tickler and she ram paged out that s what she did said joe slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at
it she ram paged out pip 
 has she been gone long joe i always treated him as a larger species
of child and as no more than my equal 
 well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock she s been on the
ram page this last spell about five minutes pip she s a coming get
behind the door old chap and have the jack towel betwixt you 
i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open 
and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and
applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing
me i often served as a connubial missile at joe who glad to get hold
of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me
up there with his great leg 
 where have you been you young monkey said mrs joe stamping her
foot tell me directly what you ve been doing to wear me away with fret
and fright and worrit or i d have you out of that corner if you was
fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys 
 i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and
rubbing myself 
 churchyard repeated my sister if it warn t for me you d have been
to the churchyard long ago and stayed there who brought you up by
hand 
 you did said i 
 and why did i do it i should like to know exclaimed my sister 
i whimpered i don t know 
 i don t said my sister i d never do it again i know that i may
truly say i ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were 
it s bad enough to be a blacksmith s wife and him a gargery without
being your mother 
my thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at
the fire for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the
mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me
in the avenging coals 
 hah said mrs joe restoring tickler to his station churchyard 
indeed you may well say churchyard you two one of us by the by had
not said it at all you ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one
of these days and o a pr r recious pair you d be without me 
as she applied herself to set the tea things joe peeped down at me
over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed after that he sat feeling his
right side flaxen curls and whisker and following mrs joe about with
his blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times 
my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us 
that never varied first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her bib where it sometimes got a pin into it and
sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths then she
took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf in
an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plaster using both
sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding
the butter off round the crust then she gave the knife a final smart
wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off
the loaf which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into
two halves of which joe got one and i the other 
on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my
slice i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man i knew
mrs joe s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe therefore
i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my
trousers 
the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i
found to be quite awful it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water 
and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe in
our already mentioned freemasonry as fellow sufferers and in his
good natured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each
other s admiration now and then which stimulated us to new exertions 
to night joe several times invited me by the display of his fast
diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition but
he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and
my untouched bread and butter on the other at last i desperately
considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it
had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at
me and got my bread and butter down my leg 
joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he
didn t seem to enjoy he turned it about in his mouth much longer than
usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like
a pill he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone 
the wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold
of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sister s
observation 
 what s the matter now said she smartly as she put down her cup 
 i say you know muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious
remonstrance pip old chap you ll do yourself a mischief it ll stick
somewhere you can t have chawed it pip 
 what s the matter now repeated my sister more sharply than before 
 if you can cough any trifle on it up pip i d recommend you to do it 
said joe all aghast manners is manners but still your elth s your
elth 
by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe 
and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while
against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily
on 
 now perhaps you ll mention what s the matter said my sister out of
breath you staring great stuck pig 
joe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and
looked at me again 
 you know pip said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek 
and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone 
 you and me is always friends and i d be the last to tell upon you 
any time but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor
between us and then again at me such a most oncommon bolt as that 
 been bolting his food has he cried my sister 
 you know old chap said joe looking at me and not at mrs joe 
with his bite still in his cheek i bolted myself when i was your
age frequent and as a boy i ve been among a many bolters but i never
see your bolting equal yet pip and it s a mercy you ain t bolted
dead 
my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying
nothing more than the awful words you come along and be dosed 
some medical beast had revived tar water in those days as a fine
medicine and mrs joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard 
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness at the
best of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice
restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new
fence on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a
pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater
comfort while mrs joe held my head under her arm as a boot would
be held in a bootjack joe got off with half a pint but was made to
swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire because he had had a turn judging from
myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had
none before 
conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when in
the case of a boy that secret burden co operates with another secret
burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great
punishment the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob mrs joe i
never thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as his united to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind then 
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the
voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
secrecy declaring that he couldn t and wouldn t starve until to morrow 
but must be fed now at other times i thought what if the young man
who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me
should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time 
and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to night 
instead of to morrow if ever anybody s hair stood on end with terror 
mine must have done so then but perhaps nobody s ever did 
it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with
a copper stick from seven to eight by the dutch clock i tried it with
the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable happily i slipped away 
and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom 
 hark said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final warm
in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed was that great guns 
joe 
 ah said joe there s another conwict off 
 what does that mean joe said i 
mrs joe who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly 
 escaped escaped administering the definition like tar water 
while mrs joe sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my
mouth into the forms of saying to joe what s a convict joe put his
mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i
could make out nothing of it but the single word pip 
 there was a conwict off last night said joe aloud after
sunset gun and they fired warning of him and now it appears they re
firing warning of another 
 who s firing said i 
 drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work 
 what a questioner he is ask no questions and you ll be told no lies 
it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be
told lies by her even if i did ask questions but she never was polite
unless there was company 
at this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word
that looked to me like sulks therefore i naturally pointed to mrs 
joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her but joe wouldn t
hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook
the form of a most emphatic word out of it but i could make nothing of
the word 
 mrs joe said i as a last resort i should like to know if you
wouldn t much mind where the firing comes from 
 lord bless the boy exclaimed my sister as if she didn t quite mean
that but rather the contrary from the hulks 
 oh h said i looking at joe hulks 
joe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say well i told you so 
 and please what s hulks said i 
 that s the way with this boy exclaimed my sister pointing me out
with her needle and thread and shaking her head at me answer him one
question and he ll ask you a dozen directly hulks are prison ships 
right cross th meshes we always used that name for marshes in our
country 
 i wonder who s put into prison ships and why they re put there said
i in a general way and with quiet desperation 
it was too much for mrs joe who immediately rose i tell you what 
young fellow said she i didn t bring you up by hand to badger
people s lives out it would be blame to me and not praise if i had 
people are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob 
and forge and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking
questions now you get along to bed 
i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went up
stairs in the dark with my head tingling from mrs joe s thimble
having played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last words i
felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
handy for me i was clearly on my way there i had begun by asking
questions and i was going to rob mrs joe 
since that time which is far enough away now i have often thought
that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror 
no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror i was in
mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver i was
in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg i was in mortal
terror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted i had
no hope of deliverance through my all powerful sister who repulsed
me at every turn i am afraid to think of what i might have done on
requirement in the secrecy of my terror 
if i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong spring tide to the hulks a ghostly
pirate calling out to me through a speaking trumpet as i passed the
gibbet station that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at
once and not put it off i was afraid to sleep even if i had been
inclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob
the pantry there was no doing it in the night for there was no getting
a light by easy friction then to have got one i must have struck it out
of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very pirate himself
rattling his chains 
as soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot
with gray i got up and went down stairs every board upon the way and
every crack in every board calling after me stop thief and get up 
mrs joe in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied than
usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare hanging
up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back was half
turned winking i had no time for verification no time for selection 
no time for anything for i had no time to spare i stole some bread 
some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i tied up in
my pocket handkerchief with my last night s slice some brandy from a
stone bottle which i decanted into a glass bottle i had secretly used
for making that intoxicating fluid spanish liquorice water up in my
room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard 
a meat bone with very little on it and a beautiful round compact pork
pie i was nearly going away without the pie but i was tempted to mount
upon a shelf to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a
covered earthen ware dish in a corner and i found it was the pie and
i took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use and would
not be missed for some time 
there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge i
unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among joe s tools 
then i put the fastenings as i had found them opened the door at which
i had entered when i ran home last night shut it and ran for the misty
marshes 
it was a rimy morning and very damp i had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all
night and using the window for a pocket handkerchief now i saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of
spiders webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade on
every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick 
that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village a
direction which they never accepted for they never came there was
invisible to me until i was quite close under it then as i looked up
at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a
phantom devoting me to the hulks 
the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that
instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me 
this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind the gates and dikes and
banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly
as could be a boy with somebody s else s pork pie stop him the
cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes 
and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief one black
ox with a white cravat on who even had to my awakened conscience
something of a clerical air fixed me so obstinately with his eyes 
and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved
round that i blubbered out to him i couldn t help it sir it wasn t
for myself i took it upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of
smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kick up of his hind legs and
a flourish of his tail 
all this time i was getting on towards the river but however fast i
went i couldn t warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as
the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet i knew
my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a
sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that when
i was prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there 
however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to
the right and consequently had to try back along the river side on the
bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
out making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a
ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled
up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me 
his back was towards me and he had his arms folded and was nodding
forward heavy with sleep 
i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast 
in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on
the shoulder he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but
another man 
and yet this man was dressed in coarse gray too and had a great iron
on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that
the other man was except that he had not the same face and had a flat
broad brimmed low crowned felt hat on all this i saw in a moment for
i had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me made a hit at
me it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
down for it made him stumble and then he ran into the mist stumbling
twice as he went and i lost him 
 it s the young man i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified
him i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had
known where it was 
i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right
man hugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all
night left off hugging and limping waiting for me he was awfully
cold to be sure i half expected to see him drop down before my face
and die of deadly cold his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when
i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to
me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle he did
not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me
right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pockets 
 what s in the bottle boy said he 
 brandy said i 
he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
manner more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
hurry than a man who was eating it but he left off to take some of
the liquor he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite
as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth 
without biting it off 
 i think you have got the ague said i 
 i m much of your opinion boy said he 
 it s bad about here i told him you ve been lying out on the meshes 
and they re dreadful aguish rheumatic too 
 i ll eat my breakfast afore they re the death of me said he i d do
that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
over there directly afterwards i ll beat the shivers so far i ll bet
you 
he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all
at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round
us and often stopping even stopping his jaws to listen some real or
fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly 
 you re not a deceiving imp you brought no one with you 
 no sir no 
 nor giv no one the office to follow you 
 no 
 well said he i believe you you d be but a fierce young hound
indeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched
warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint
is 
something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock 
and was going to strike and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his
eyes 
pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down
upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it 
 did you speak 
 i said i was glad you enjoyed it 
 thankee my boy i do 
i had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and i now
noticed a decided similarity between the dog s way of eating and the
man s the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog he
swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast 
and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought
there was danger in every direction of somebody s coming to take the pie
away he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate
it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without
making a chop with his jaws at the visitor in all of which particulars
he was very like the dog 
 i am afraid you won t leave any of it for him said i timidly after
a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making
the remark there s no more to be got where that came from it was the
certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint 
 leave any for him who s him said my friend stopping in his
crunching of pie crust 
 the young man that you spoke of that was hid with you 
 oh ah he returned with something like a gruff laugh him yes yes 
he don t want no wittles 
 i thought he looked as if he did said i 
the man stopped eating and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and
the greatest surprise 
 looked when 
 just now 
 where 
 yonder said i pointing over there where i found him nodding
asleep and thought it was you 
he held me by the collar and stared at me so that i began to think his
first idea about cutting my throat had revived 
 dressed like you you know only with a hat i explained trembling 
 and and i was very anxious to put this delicately and with the
same reason for wanting to borrow a file didn t you hear the cannon
last night 
 then there was firing he said to himself 
 i wonder you shouldn t have been sure of that i returned for
we heard it up at home and that s farther away and we were shut in
besides 
 why see now said he when a man s alone on these flats with a
light head and a light stomach perishing of cold and want he hears
nothin all night but guns firing and voices calling hears he sees
the soldiers with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried
afore closing in round him hears his number called hears himself
challenged hears the rattle of the muskets hears the orders make
ready present cover him steady men and is laid hands on and
there s nothin why if i see one pursuing party last night coming up
in order damn em with their tramp tramp i see a hundred and as to
firing why i see the mist shake with the cannon arter it was broad
day but this man he had said all the rest as if he had forgotten my
being there did you notice anything in him 
 he had a badly bruised face said i recalling what i hardly knew i
knew 
 not here exclaimed the man striking his left cheek mercilessly with
the flat of his hand 
 yes there 
 where is he he crammed what little food was left into the breast of
his gray jacket show me the way he went i ll pull him down like a
bloodhound curse this iron on my sore leg give us hold of the file 
boy 
i indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man 
and he looked up at it for an instant but he was down on the rank wet
grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding
his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he
handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file i
was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into
this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away
from home any longer i told him i must go but he took no notice so
i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off the last i saw
of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his
fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg the last
i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still
going 
i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me
up but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet
been made of the robbery mrs joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
house ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon
the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust pan an article into
which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was
vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment 
 and where the deuce ha you been was mrs joe s christmas salutation 
when i and my conscience showed ourselves 
i said i had been down to hear the carols ah well observed mrs 
joe you might ha done worse not a doubt of that i thought 
 perhaps if i warn t a blacksmith s wife and what s the same thing a
slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols 
said mrs joe i m rather partial to carols myself and that s the
best of reasons for my never hearing any 
joe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a
conciliatory air when mrs joe darted a look at him and when her eyes
were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them
to me as our token that mrs joe was in a cross temper this was so
much her normal state that joe and i would often for weeks together 
be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to their legs 
we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls a handsome mince pie had
been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not
being missed and the pudding was already on the boil these extensive
arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
breakfast for i ain t said mrs joe i ain t a going to have
no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what i ve got
before me i promise you 
so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a
forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of milk
and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser in
the meantime mrs joe put clean white curtains up and tacked a new
flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and
uncovered the little state parlor across the passage which was never
uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool
haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white
crockery poodles on the mantel shelf each with a black nose and a
basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other 
mrs joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of
making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt
itself cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by
their religion 
my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that
is to say joe and i were going in his working clothes joe was a
well knit characteristic looking blacksmith in his holiday clothes 
he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else 
nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and
everything that he wore then grazed him on the present festive occasion
he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture
of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials as to me i think my
sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom
an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over
to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law 
i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition
to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the
dissuading arguments of my best friends even when i was taken to have
a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of
reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs 
joe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds yet what i suffered outside was nothing to
what i underwent within the terrors that had assailed me whenever
mrs joe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the
church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment i conceived the
idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said 
 ye are now to declare it would be the time for me to rise and propose
a private conference in the vestry i am far from being sure that i
might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this
extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday 
mr wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us and mr hubble
the wheelwright and mrs hubble and uncle pumblechook joe s uncle 
but mrs joe appropriated him who was a well to do cornchandler in
the nearest town and drove his own chaise cart the dinner hour was
half past one when joe and i got home we found the table laid and
mrs joe dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked
 it never was at any other time for the company to enter by and
everything most splendid and still not a word of the robbery 
the time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and
the company came mr wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining
bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of indeed
it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him
his head he would read the clergyman into fits he himself confessed
that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would
not despair of making his mark in it the church not being thrown
open he was as i have said our clerk but he punished the amens
tremendously and when he gave out the psalm always giving the whole
verse he looked all round the congregation first as much as to say 
 you have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this
style 
i opened the door to the company making believe that it was a habit
of ours to open that door and i opened it first to mr wopsle next
to mr and mrs hubble and last of all to uncle pumblechook n b i was
not allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties 
 mrs joe said uncle pumblechook a large hard breathing middle aged
slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair
standing upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been
all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the
compliments of the season i have brought you mum a bottle of sherry
wine and i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine 
every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with
exactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumb bells 
every christmas day mrs joe replied as she now replied o un cle
pum ble chook this is kind every christmas day he retorted as
he now retorted it s no more than your merits and now are you all
bobbish and how s sixpennorth of halfpence meaning me 
we dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts
and oranges and apples to the parlor which was a change very like
joe s change from his working clothes to his sunday dress my sister was
uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more
gracious in the society of mrs hubble than in other company i remember
mrs hubble as a little curly sharp edged person in sky blue who held a
conventionally juvenile position because she had married mr hubble i
don t know at what remote period when she was much younger than he i
remember mr hubble as a tough high shouldered stooping old man of a
sawdusty fragrance with his legs extraordinarily wide apart so that in
my short days i always saw some miles of open country between them when
i met him coming up the lane 
among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadn t
robbed the pantry in a false position not because i was squeezed in
at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the
pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak
 i didn t want to speak nor because i was regaled with the scaly tips
of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure corners of pork
of which the pig when living had had the least reason to be vain no 
i should not have minded that if they would only have left me alone 
but they wouldn t leave me alone they seemed to think the opportunity
lost if they failed to point the conversation at me every now and
then and stick the point into me i might have been an unfortunate
little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched up by these
moral goads 
it began the moment we sat down to dinner mr wopsle said grace with
theatrical declamation as it now appears to me something like a
religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the third and
ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful 
upon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low
reproachful voice do you hear that be grateful 
 especially said mr pumblechook be grateful boy to them which
brought you up by hand 
mrs hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful
presentiment that i should come to no good asked why is it that the
young are never grateful this moral mystery seemed too much for
the company until mr hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally
wicious everybody then murmured true and looked at me in a
particularly unpleasant and personal manner 
joe s station and influence were something feebler if possible when
there was company than when there was none but he always aided and
comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so
at dinner time by giving me gravy if there were any there being plenty
of gravy to day joe spooned into my plate at this point about half a
pint 
a little later on in the dinner mr wopsle reviewed the sermon with
some severity and intimated in the usual hypothetical case of the
church being thrown open what kind of sermon he would have given
them after favoring them with some heads of that discourse he remarked
that he considered the subject of the day s homily ill chosen which
was the less excusable he added when there were so many subjects
 going about 
 true again said uncle pumblechook you ve hit it sir plenty of
subjects going about for them that know how to put salt upon their
tails that s what s wanted a man needn t go far to find a subject 
if he s ready with his salt box mr pumblechook added after a short
interval of reflection look at pork alone there s a subject if you
want a subject look at pork 
 true sir many a moral for the young returned mr wopsle and i
knew he was going to lug me in before he said it might be deduced
from that text 
 you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis 
joe gave me some more gravy 
 swine pursued mr wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork
at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian name swine were
the companions of the prodigal the gluttony of swine is put before us 
as an example to the young i thought this pretty well in him who
had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy what is
detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy 
 or girl suggested mr hubble 
 of course or girl mr hubble assented mr wopsle rather irritably 
 but there is no girl present 
 besides said mr pumblechook turning sharp on me think what you ve
got to be grateful for if you d been born a squeaker 
 he was if ever a child was said my sister most emphatically 
joe gave me some more gravy 
 well but i mean a four footed squeaker said mr pumblechook if you
had been born such would you have been here now not you 
 unless in that form said mr wopsle nodding towards the dish 
 but i don t mean in that form sir returned mr pumblechook who had
an objection to being interrupted i mean enjoying himself with his
elders and betters and improving himself with their conversation and
rolling in the lap of luxury would he have been doing that no he
wouldn t and what would have been your destination turning on me
again you would have been disposed of for so many shillings according
to the market price of the article and dunstable the butcher would have
come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped you
under his left arm and with his right he would have tucked up his frock
to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat pocket and he would have
shed your blood and had your life no bringing up by hand then not a
bit of it 
joe offered me more gravy which i was afraid to take 
 he was a world of trouble to you ma am said mrs hubble 
commiserating my sister 
 trouble echoed my sister trouble and then entered on a fearful
catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts
of sleeplessness i had committed and all the high places i had tumbled
from and all the low places i had tumbled into and all the injuries i
had done myself and all the times she had wished me in my grave and i
had contumaciously refused to go there 
i think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with
their noses perhaps they became the restless people they were in
consequence anyhow mr wopsle s roman nose so aggravated me during
the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it
until he howled but all i had endured up to this time was nothing in
comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the
pause was broken which ensued upon my sister s recital and in which
pause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully conscious with
indignation and abhorrence 
 yet said mr pumblechook leading the company gently back to the
theme from which they had strayed pork regarded as biled is rich 
too ain t it 
 have a little brandy uncle said my sister 
o heavens it had come at last he would find it was weak he would say
it was weak and i was lost i held tight to the leg of the table under
the cloth with both hands and awaited my fate 
my sister went for the stone bottle came back with the stone bottle 
and poured his brandy out no one else taking any the wretched man
trifled with his glass took it up looked at it through the light 
put it down prolonged my misery all this time mrs joe and joe were
briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding 
i couldn t keep my eyes off him always holding tight by the leg of the
table with my hands and feet i saw the miserable creature finger his
glass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink
the brandy off instantly afterwards the company were seized with
unspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his feet turning
round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping cough dance 
and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window 
violently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous faces and
apparently out of his mind 
i held on tight while mrs joe and joe ran to him i didn t know how
i had done it but i had no doubt i had murdered him somehow in my
dreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and
surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him sank
down into his chair with the one significant gasp tar 
i had filled up the bottle from the tar water jug i knew he would be
worse by and by i moved the table like a medium of the present day by
the vigor of my unseen hold upon it 
 tar cried my sister in amazement why how ever could tar come
there 
but uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldn t
hear the word wouldn t hear of the subject imperiously waved it all
away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water my sister who had
begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in
getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemon peel and mixing
them for the time being at least i was saved i still held on to the
leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude 
by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
pudding mr pumblechook partook of pudding all partook of pudding 
the course terminated and mr pumblechook had begun to beam under the
genial influence of gin and water i began to think i should get over
the day when my sister said to joe clean plates cold 
i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my
bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul 
i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was gone 
 you must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best
grace you must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious
present of uncle pumblechook s 
must they let them not hope to taste it 
 you must know said my sister rising it s a pie a savory pork
pie 
the company murmured their compliments uncle pumblechook sensible of
having deserved well of his fellow creatures said quite vivaciously 
all things considered well mrs joe we ll do our best endeavors 
let us have a cut at this same pie 
my sister went out to get it i heard her steps proceed to the pantry i
saw mr pumblechook balance his knife i saw reawakening appetite in the
roman nostrils of mr wopsle i heard mr hubble remark that a bit of
savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do
no harm and i heard joe say you shall have some pip i have never
been absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror 
merely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company i felt that i
could bear no more and that i must run away i released the leg of the
table and ran for my life 
but i ran no farther than the house door for there i ran head foremost
into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair
of handcuffs to me saying here you are look sharp come on 
the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but ends of their
loaded muskets on our door step caused the dinner party to rise
from table in confusion and caused mrs joe re entering the kitchen
empty handed to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of
 gracious goodness gracious me what s gone with the pie 
the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when mrs joe stood staring 
at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses it was
the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the
company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his
right hand and his left on my shoulder 
 excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have
mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadn t i
am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith 
 and pray what might you want with him retorted my sister quick to
resent his being wanted at all 
 missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should
reply the honor and pleasure of his fine wife s acquaintance speaking
for the king i answer a little job done 
this was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that mr 
pumblechook cried audibly good again 
 you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked
out joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find
the lock of one of em goes wrong and the coupling don t act pretty 
as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over
them 
joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer
two hours than one will it then will you set about it at once 
blacksmith said the off hand sergeant as it s on his majesty s
service and if my men can bear a hand anywhere they ll make themselves
useful with that he called to his men who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner and then
they stood about as soldiers do now with their hands loosely clasped
before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now easing a belt or a
pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out
into the yard 
all these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i
was in an agony of apprehension but beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little
more of my scattered wits 
 would you give me the time said the sergeant addressing himself to
mr pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the
inference that he was equal to the time 
 it s just gone half past two 
 that s not so bad said the sergeant reflecting even if i was
forced to halt here nigh two hours that ll do how far might you call
yourselves from the marshes hereabouts not above a mile i reckon 
 just a mile said mrs joe 
 that ll do we begin to close in upon em about dusk a little before
dusk my orders are that ll do 
 convicts sergeant asked mr wopsle in a matter of course way 
 ay returned the sergeant two they re pretty well known to be out
on the marshes still and they won t try to get clear of em before
dusk anybody here seen anything of any such game 
everybody myself excepted said no with confidence nobody thought of
me 
 well said the sergeant they ll find themselves trapped in a circle 
i expect sooner than they count on now blacksmith if you re ready 
his majesty the king is 
joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron
on and passed into the forge one of the soldiers opened its wooden
windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the
rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring then joe began to
hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on 
the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
attention but even made my sister liberal she drew a pitcher of beer
from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass
of brandy but mr pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum i ll
engage there s no tar in that so the sergeant thanked him and said
that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it
was equally convenient when it was given him he drank his majesty s
health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and
smacked his lips 
 good stuff eh sergeant said mr pumblechook 
 i ll tell you something returned the sergeant i suspect that
stuff s of your providing 
mr pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay why 
 because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder you re
a man that knows what s what 
 d ye think so said mr pumblechook with his former laugh have
another glass 
 with you hob and nob returned the sergeant the top of mine to the
foot of yours the foot of yours to the top of mine ring once ring
twice the best tune on the musical glasses your health may you live
a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you
are at the present moment of your life 
the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass i noticed that mr pumblechook in his hospitality
appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the
bottle from mrs joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a
gush of joviality even i got some and he was so very free of the wine
that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the
same liberality when the first was gone 
as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge 
enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was they had not enjoyed
themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened
with the excitement he furnished and now when they were all in lively
anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows
seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke
to hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them 
and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the
blaze rose and sank and the red hot sparks dropped and died the pale
afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned
pale on their account poor wretches 
at last joe s job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped as joe
got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should
go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt mr pumblechook
and mr hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society but
mr wopsle said he would go if joe would joe said he was agreeable 
and would take me if mrs joe approved we never should have got leave
to go i am sure but for mrs joe s curiosity to know all about it and
how it ended as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy
back with his head blown to bits by a musket don t look to me to put it
together again 
the sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from mr 
pumblechook as from a comrade though i doubt if he were quite as fully
sensible of that gentleman s merits under arid conditions as when
something moist was going his men resumed their muskets and fell in 
mr wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and
to speak no word after we reached the marshes when we were all out in
the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably
whispered to joe i hope joe we shan t find them and joe whispered
to me i d give a shilling if they had cut and run pip 
we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was
cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming
on and the people had good fires in doors and were keeping the day a
few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came
out we passed the finger post and held straight on to the churchyard 
there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant s
hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the
graves and also examined the porch they came in again without finding
anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate
at the side of the churchyard a bitter sleet came rattling against us
here on the east wind and joe took me on his back 
now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little
thought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men
hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should
come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who
had brought the soldiers there he had asked me if i was a deceiving
imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the
hunt against him would he believe that i was both imp and hound in
treacherous earnest and had betrayed him 
it was of no use asking myself this question now there i was on joe s
back and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a
hunter and stimulating mr wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and
to keep up with us the soldiers were in front of us extending into a
pretty wide line with an interval between man and man we were taking
the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist 
either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it 
under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the
mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain 
though all of a watery lead color 
with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joe s broad shoulder i
looked all about for any sign of the convicts i could see none i could
hear none mr wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his
blowing and hard breathing but i knew the sounds by this time and
could dissociate them from the object of pursuit i got a dreadful
start when i thought i heard the file still going but it was only a
sheep bell the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at
us and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared
angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except
these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass 
there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes 
the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we
were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all
stopped for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a
long shout it was repeated it was at a distance towards the east but
it was long and loud nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
together if one might judge from a confusion in the sound 
to this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under
their breath when joe and i came up after another moment s listening 
joe who was a good judge agreed and mr wopsle who was a bad judge 
agreed the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not
be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men
should make towards it at the double so we slanted to the right
 where the east was and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had to
hold on tight to keep my seat 
it was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he
spoke all the time a winder down banks and up banks and over gates 
and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared
where he went as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and
more apparent that it was made by more than one voice sometimes it
seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped when it broke
out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we
after them after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one
voice calling murder and another voice convicts runaways guard 
this way for the runaway convicts then both voices would seem to be
stifled in a struggle and then would break out again and when it had
come to this the soldiers ran like deer and joe too 
the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two
of his men ran in close upon him their pieces were cocked and levelled
when we all ran in 
 here are both men panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a
ditch surrender you two and confound you for two wild beasts come
asunder 
water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and
blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to
help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other
one both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but
of course i knew them both directly 
 mind said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged
sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers i took him i give him
up to you mind that 
 it s not much to be particular about said the sergeant it ll do you
small good my man being in the same plight yourself handcuffs there 
 i don t expect it to do me any good i don t want it to do me more good
than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh i took him he
knows it that s enough for me 
the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old
bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over 
he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both
separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
falling 
 take notice guard he tried to murder me were his first words 
 tried to murder him said my convict disdainfully try and not
do it i took him and giv him up that s what i done i not only
prevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him here dragged
him this far on his way back he s a gentleman if you please this
villain now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me murder
him worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag
him back 
the other one still gasped he tried he tried to murder me 
bear bear witness 
 lookee here said my convict to the sergeant single handed i got
clear of the prison ship i made a dash and i done it i could ha got
clear of these death cold flats likewise look at my leg you won t find
much iron on it if i hadn t made the discovery that he was here let
him go free let him profit by the means as i found out let him make a
tool of me afresh and again once more no no no if i had died at
the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his
manacled hands i d have held to him with that grip that you should
have been safe to find him in my hold 
the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his
companion repeated he tried to murder me i should have been a dead
man if you had not come up 
 he lies said my convict with fierce energy he s a liar born and
he ll die a liar look at his face ain t it written there let him turn
those eyes of his on me i defy him to do it 
the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however 
collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked
at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but
certainly did not look at the speaker 
 do you see him pursued my convict do you see what a villain he is 
do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes that s how he looked
when we were tried together he never looked at me 
the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes
restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on
the speaker with the words you are not much to look at and with
a half taunting glance at the bound hands at that point my convict
became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him
but for the interposition of the soldiers didn t i tell you said the
other convict then that he would murder me if he could and any one
could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his
lips curious white flakes like thin snow 
 enough of this parley said the sergeant light those torches 
as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down
on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time 
and saw me i had alighted from joe s back on the brink of the ditch
when we came up and had not moved since i looked at him eagerly when
he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head i had
been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my
innocence it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended
my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it
all passed in a moment but if he had looked at me for an hour or for
a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having
been more attentive 
the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four
torches and took one himself and distributed the others it had been
almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards
very dark before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in
a ring fired twice into the air presently we saw other torches kindled
at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite
bank of the river all right said the sergeant march 
we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a
sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear you are expected
on board said the sergeant to my convict they know you are coming 
don t straggle my man close up here 
the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard 
i had hold of joe s hand now and joe carried one of the torches mr 
wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to see it out so
we went on with the party there was a reasonably good path now mostly
on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike
came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice gate when
i looked round i could see the other lights coming in after us the
torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and
i could see those too lying smoking and flaring i could see nothing
else but black darkness our lights warmed the air about us with their
pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they
limped along in the midst of the muskets we could not go fast because
of their lameness and they were so spent that two or three times we
had to halt while they rested 
after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut
and a landing place there was a guard in the hut and they challenged 
and the sergeant answered then we went into the hut where there was
a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and
a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an
overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen
soldiers all at once three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their
great coats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads
and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again the sergeant made some
kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i
call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board
first 
my convict never looked at me except that once while we stood in the
hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up
his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if
he pitied them for their recent adventures suddenly he turned to the
sergeant and remarked 
 i wish to say something respecting this escape it may prevent some
persons laying under suspicion alonger me 
 you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly
looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it
here you ll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it 
before it s done with you know 
 i know but this is another pint a separate matter a man can t
starve at least i can t i took some wittles up at the willage over
yonder where the church stands a most out on the marshes 
 you mean stole said the sergeant 
 and i ll tell you where from from the blacksmith s 
 halloa said the sergeant staring at joe 
 halloa pip said joe staring at me 
 it was some broken wittles that s what it was and a dram of liquor 
and a pie 
 have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith asked
the sergeant confidentially 
 my wife did at the very moment when you came in don t you know pip 
 so said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and
without the least glance at me so you re the blacksmith are you 
than i m sorry to say i ve eat your pie 
 god knows you re welcome to it so far as it was ever mine returned
joe with a saving remembrance of mrs joe we don t know what you have
done but we wouldn t have you starved to death for it poor miserable
fellow creatur would us pip 
the something that i had noticed before clicked in the man s throat
again and he turned his back the boat had returned and his guard were
ready so we followed him to the landing place made of rough stakes
and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of
convicts like himself no one seemed surprised to see him or interested
in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word 
except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way 
you which was the signal for the dip of the oars by the light of the
torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of
the shore like a wicked noah s ark cribbed and barred and moored by
massive rusty chains the prison ship seemed in my young eyes to be
ironed like the prisoners we saw the boat go alongside and we saw
him taken up the side and disappear then the ends of the torches were
flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with
him 
my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so
unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but i hope
it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it 
i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to mrs joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me but
i loved joe perhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love him and as to him my inner self
was not so easily composed it was much upon my mind particularly when
i first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell joe the
whole truth yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that
if i did he would think me worse than i was the fear of losing joe s
confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my
tongue i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i never
afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker 
without thinking that he was meditating on it that if joe knew it i
never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterday s
meat or pudding when it came on to day s table without thinking that he
was debating whether i had been in the pantry that if joe knew it and
at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his
beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it 
would bring a rush of blood to my face in a word i was too cowardly
to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what i knew to be wrong i had had no intercourse with the world at
that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of
action for myself 
as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prison ship joe took
me on his back again and carried me home he must have had a tiresome
journey of it for mr wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad
temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have
excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself in
his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such
an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the
kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have
hanged him if it had been a capital offence 
by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having
been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
tongues as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the
shoulders and the restorative exclamation yah was there ever such
a boy as this from my sister i found joe telling them about the
convict s confession and all the visitors suggesting different ways
by which he had got into the pantry mr pumblechook made out after
carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of
the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let
himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut
into strips and as mr pumblechook was very positive and drove his
own chaise cart over everybody it was agreed that it must be so mr 
wopsle indeed wildly cried out no with the feeble malice of a
tired man but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously
set at naught not to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood
with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not
calculated to inspire confidence 
this was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a
slumberous offence to the company s eyesight and assisted me up to bed
with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be
dangling them all against the edges of the stairs my state of mind as
i have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted
long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned
saving on exceptional occasions 
at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out my
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i
read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my father s
exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family neither were my notions
of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at
all accurate for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my
declaration that i was to walk in the same all the days of my life 
laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down
by the wheelwright s or up by the mill 
when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i could
assume that dignity i was not to be what mrs joe called pompeyed or
 as i render it pampered therefore i was not only odd boy about the
forge but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favored with the
employment in order however that our superior position might not be
compromised thereby a money box was kept on the kitchen mantel shelf 
in to which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were
dropped i have an impression that they were to be contributed
eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i
had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure 
mr wopsle s great aunt kept an evening school in the village that is
to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in
the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving
opportunity of seeing her do it she rented a small cottage and mr 
wopsle had the room up stairs where we students used to overhear him
reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally
bumping on the ceiling there was a fiction that mr wopsle examined 
the scholars once a quarter what he did on those occasions was to turn
up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antony s oration over
the body of caesar this was always followed by collins s ode on
the passions wherein i particularly venerated mr wopsle as revenge
throwing his blood stained sword in thunder down and taking the
war denouncing trumpet with a withering look it was not with me then 
as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions 
and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the disadvantage of
both gentlemen 
mr wopsle s great aunt besides keeping this educational institution 
kept in the same room a little general shop she had no idea what stock
she had or what the price of anything in it was but there was a little
greasy memorandum book kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue
of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transaction 
biddy was mr wopsle s great aunt s granddaughter i confess myself
quiet unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was
to mr wopsle she was an orphan like myself like me too had been
brought up by hand she was most noticeable i thought in respect of
her extremities for her hair always wanted brushing her hands always
wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at
heel this description must be received with a week day limitation on
sundays she went to church elaborated 
much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of mr 
wopsle s great aunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
a bramble bush getting considerably worried and scratched by every
letter after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who
seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
baffle recognition but at last i began in a purblind groping way to
read write and cipher on the very smallest scale 
one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending
great efforts on the production of a letter to joe i think it must have
been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a long
time after and it was winter and a hard frost with an alphabet on the
hearth at my feet for reference i contrived in an hour or two to print
and smear this epistle 
 mi deer jo i ope u r kr wite well i ope i shal son b habell teedge
u jo an then we shorl b so glodd an wen i m prengtd u jo wot larx an
bleve me inf xn pip 
there was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with joe by
letter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone but i delivered
this written communication slate and all with my own hand and joe
received it as a miracle of erudition 
 i say pip old chap cried joe opening his blue eyes wide what a
scholar you are an t you 
 i should like to be said i glancing at the slate as he held it with
a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly 
 why here s a j said joe and a o equal to anythink here s a j and
a o pip and a j o joe 
i had never heard joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
monosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i
accidentally held our prayer book upside down that it seemed to suit
his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right wishing to
embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching joe i
should have to begin quite at the beginning i said ah but read the
rest jo 
 the rest eh pip said joe looking at it with a slow searching eye 
 one two three why here s three js and three os and three j o 
joes in it pip 
i leaned over joe and with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole
letter 
 astonishing said joe when i had finished you are a scholar 
 how do you spell gargery joe i asked him with a modest patronage 
 i don t spell it at all said joe 
 but supposing you did 
 it can t be supposed said joe tho i m uncommon fond of reading 
too 
 are you joe 
 on common give me said joe a good book or a good newspaper and
sit me down afore a good fire and i ask no better lord he continued 
after rubbing his knees a little when you do come to a j and a o and
says you here at last is a j o joe how interesting reading is 
i derived from this that joe s education like steam was yet in its
infancy pursuing the subject i inquired 
 didn t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me 
 no pip 
 why didn t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me 
 well pip said joe taking up the poker and settling himself to
his usual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire
between the lower bars i ll tell you my father pip he were given
to drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at
my mother most onmerciful it were a most the only hammering he did 
indeed xcepting at myself and he hammered at me with a wigor only
to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn t hammer at his
anwil you re a listening and understanding pip 
 yes joe 
 consequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several
times and then my mother she d go out to work and she d say joe 
she d say now please god you shall have some schooling child and
she d put me to school but my father were that good in his hart that
he couldn t abear to be without us so he d come with a most tremenjous
crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was that
they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us
up to him and then he took us home and hammered us which you see 
pip said joe pausing in his meditative raking of the fire and
looking at me were a drawback on my learning 
 certainly poor joe 
 though mind you pip said joe with a judicial touch or two of the
poker on the top bar rendering unto all their doo and maintaining
equal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his hart 
don t you see 
i didn t see but i didn t say so 
 well joe pursued somebody must keep the pot a biling pip or the
pot won t bile don t you know 
i saw that and said so 
 consequence my father didn t make objections to my going to work so
i went to work at my present calling which were his too if he
would have followed it and i worked tolerable hard i assure you pip 
in time i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a
purple leptic fit and it were my intentions to have had put upon his
tombstone that whatsume er the failings on his part remember reader he
were that good in his heart 
joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful
perspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself 
 i made it said joe my own self i made it in a moment it was like
striking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow i never was so much
surprised in all my life couldn t credit my own ed to tell you the
truth hardly believed it were my own ed as i was saying pip it were
my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs money cut
it how you will small or large and it were not done not to mention
bearers all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother 
she were in poor elth and quite broke she weren t long of following 
poor soul and her share of peace come round at last 
joe s blue eyes turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them and
then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner with the
round knob on the top of the poker 
 it were but lonesome then said joe living here alone and i got
acquainted with your sister now pip joe looked firmly at me as
if he knew i was not going to agree with him your sister is a fine
figure of a woman 
i could not help looking at the fire in an obvious state of doubt 
 whatever family opinions or whatever the world s opinions on that
subject may be pip your sister is joe tapped the top bar with the
poker after every word following a fine figure of a woman 
i could think of nothing better to say than i am glad you think so 
joe 
 so am i returned joe catching me up i am glad i think so pip a
little redness or a little matter of bone here or there what does it
signify to me 
i sagaciously observed if it didn t signify to him to whom did it
signify 
 certainly assented joe that s it you re right old chap when i
got acquainted with your sister it were the talk how she was bringing
you up by hand very kind of her too all the folks said and i said 
along with all the folks as to you joe pursued with a countenance
expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed if you could have
been aware how small and flabby and mean you was dear me you d have
formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself 
not exactly relishing this i said never mind me joe 
 but i did mind you pip he returned with tender simplicity when
i offered to your sister to keep company and to be asked in church at
such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge i said to
her and bring the poor little child god bless the poor little child 
i said to your sister there s room for him at the forge 
i broke out crying and begging pardon and hugged joe round the neck 
who dropped the poker to hug me and to say ever the best of friends 
an t us pip don t cry old chap 
when this little interruption was over joe resumed 
 well you see pip and here we are that s about where it lights here
we are now when you take me in hand in my learning pip and i tell
you beforehand i am awful dull most awful dull mrs joe mustn t see
too much of what we re up to it must be done as i may say on the sly 
and why on the sly i ll tell you why pip 
he had taken up the poker again without which i doubt if he could have
proceeded in his demonstration 
 your sister is given to government 
 given to government joe i was startled for i had some shadowy idea
 and i am afraid i must add hope that joe had divorced her in a favor
of the lords of the admiralty or treasury 
 given to government said joe which i meantersay the government of
you and myself 
 oh 
 and she an t over partial to having scholars on the premises joe
continued and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
scholar for fear as i might rise like a sort of rebel don t you see 
i was going to retort with an inquiry and had got as far as why 
when joe stopped me 
 stay a bit i know what you re a going to say pip stay a bit i don t
deny that your sister comes the mo gul over us now and again i don t
deny that she do throw us back falls and that she do drop down upon us
heavy at such times as when your sister is on the ram page pip joe
sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door candor compels fur
to admit that she is a buster 
joe pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital
bs 
 why don t i rise that were your observation when i broke it off pip 
 yes joe 
 well said joe passing the poker into his left hand that he might
feel his whisker and i had no hope of him whenever he took to that
placid occupation your sister s a master mind a master mind 
 what s that i asked in some hope of bringing him to a stand but
joe was readier with his definition than i had expected and completely
stopped me by arguing circularly and answering with a fixed look 
 her 
 and i ain t a master mind joe resumed when he had unfixed his look 
and got back to his whisker and last of all pip and this i want to
say very serious to you old chap i see so much in my poor mother 
of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never
getting no peace in her mortal days that i m dead afeerd of going wrong
in the way of not doing what s right by a woman and i d fur rather
of the two go wrong the t other way and be a little ill conwenienced
myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warn t
no tickler for you old chap i wish i could take it all on myself 
but this is the up and down and straight on it pip and i hope you ll
overlook shortcomings 
young as i was i believe that i dated a new admiration of joe from that
night we were equals afterwards as we had been before but afterwards
at quiet times when i sat looking at joe and thinking about him i had
a new sensation of feeling conscious that i was looking up to joe in my
heart 
 however said joe rising to replenish the fire here s the
dutch clock a working himself up to being equal to strike eight of em 
and she s not come home yet i hope uncle pumblechook s mare mayn t have
set a forefoot on a piece o ice and gone down 
mrs joe made occasional trips with uncle pumblechook on market days 
to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a
woman s judgment uncle pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no
confidences in his domestic servant this was market day and mrs joe
was out on one of these expeditions 
joe made the fire and swept the hearth and then we went to the door to
listen for the chaise cart it was a dry cold night and the wind blew
keenly and the frost was white and hard a man would die to night of
lying out on the marshes i thought and then i looked at the stars and
considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them
as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the glittering
multitude 
 here comes the mare said joe ringing like a peal of bells 
the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she
came along at a much brisker trot than usual we got a chair out ready
for mrs joe s alighting and stirred up the fire that they might see a
bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might
be out of its place when we had completed these preparations they
drove up wrapped to the eyes mrs joe was soon landed and uncle
pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with a cloth and we
were soon all in the kitchen carrying so much cold air in with us that
it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire 
 now said mrs joe unwrapping herself with haste and excitement and
throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings 
 if this boy ain t grateful this night he never will be 
i looked as grateful as any boy possibly could who was wholly
uninformed why he ought to assume that expression 
 it s only to be hoped said my sister that he won t be pompeyed but
i have my fears 
 she ain t in that line mum said mr pumblechook she knows better 
she i looked at joe making the motion with my lips and eyebrows 
 she joe looked at me making the motion with his lips and eyebrows 
 she my sister catching him in the act he drew the back of his hand
across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions and
looked at her 
 well said my sister in her snappish way what are you staring at 
is the house afire 
 which some individual joe politely hinted mentioned she 
 and she is a she i suppose said my sister unless you call miss
havisham a he and i doubt if even you ll go so far as that 
 miss havisham up town said joe 
 is there any miss havisham down town returned my sister 
 she wants this boy to go and play there and of course he s going and
he had better play there said my sister shaking her head at me as an
encouragement to be extremely light and sportive or i ll work him 
i had heard of miss havisham up town everybody for miles round had
heard of miss havisham up town as an immensely rich and grim lady who
lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers and who
led a life of seclusion 
 well to be sure said joe astounded i wonder how she come to know
pip 
 noodle cried my sister who said she knew him 
 which some individual joe again politely hinted mentioned that
she wanted him to go and play there 
 and couldn t she ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and
play there isn t it just barely possible that uncle pumblechook may be
a tenant of hers and that he may sometimes we won t say quarterly
or half yearly for that would be requiring too much of you but
sometimes go there to pay his rent and couldn t she then ask uncle
pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there and couldn t uncle
pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for us though you
may not think it joseph in a tone of the deepest reproach as if
he were the most callous of nephews then mention this boy standing
prancing here which i solemnly declare i was not doing that i have
for ever been a willing slave to 
 good again cried uncle pumblechook well put prettily pointed good
indeed now joseph you know the case 
 no joseph said my sister still in a reproachful manner while joe
apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose 
 you do not yet though you may not think it know the case you may
consider that you do but you do not joseph for you do not know that
uncle pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell this
boy s fortune may be made by his going to miss havisham s has offered
to take him into town to night in his own chaise cart and to keep
him to night and to take him with his own hands to miss havisham s
to morrow morning and lor a mussy me cried my sister casting off her
bonnet in sudden desperation here i stand talking to mere mooncalfs 
with uncle pumblechook waiting and the mare catching cold at the door 
and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the
sole of his foot 
with that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face was
squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps of
water butts and i was soaped and kneaded and towelled and thumped 
and harrowed and rasped until i really was quite beside myself i
may here remark that i suppose myself to be better acquainted than
any living authority with the ridgy effect of a wedding ring passing
unsympathetically over the human countenance 
when my ablutions were completed i was put into clean linen of the
stiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was
trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit i was then delivered
over to mr pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the
sheriff and who let off upon me the speech that i knew he had been
dying to make all along boy be forever grateful to all friends but
especially unto them which brought you up by hand 
 good bye joe 
 god bless you pip old chap 
i had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what
with soapsuds i could at first see no stars from the chaise cart 
but they twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the
questions why on earth i was going to play at miss havisham s and what
on earth i was expected to play at 
mr pumblechook s premises in the high street of the market town 
were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a
cornchandler and seedsman should be it appeared to me that he must be a
very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop and
i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the
tied up brown paper packets inside whether the flower seeds and bulbs
ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom 
it was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this
speculation on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in
an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the
bedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
eyebrows in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity
between seeds and corduroys mr pumblechook wore corduroys and so did
his shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavor about the
corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavor
about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i hardly knew
which was which the same opportunity served me for noticing that mr 
pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the
street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping
his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his
hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded
his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at
the chemist the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with
a magnifying glass at his eye and always inspected by a group of
smock frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop window 
seemed to be about the only person in the high street whose trade
engaged his attention 
mr pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight o clock in the parlor behind
the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread
and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises i considered mr 
pumblechook wretched company besides being possessed by my sister s
idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted
to my diet besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination
with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into
my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out
altogether his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic on
my politely bidding him good morning he said pompously seven times
nine boy and how should i be able to answer dodged in that way in
a strange place on an empty stomach i was hungry but before i had
swallowed a morsel he began a running sum that lasted all through the
breakfast seven and four and eight and six and two and
ten and so on and after each figure was disposed of it was as much
as i could do to get a bite or a sup before the next came while he sat
at his ease guessing nothing and eating bacon and hot roll in if i
may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner 
for such reasons i was very glad when ten o clock came and we started
for miss havisham s though i was not at all at my ease regarding the
manner in which i should acquit myself under that lady s roof within
a quarter of an hour we came to miss havisham s house which was of old
brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it some of the
windows had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were
rustily barred there was a courtyard in front and that was barred so
we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come
to open it while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then mr 
pumblechook said and fourteen but i pretended not to hear him and
saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery no brewing
was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long
time 
a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name to which my
conductor replied pumblechook the voice returned quite right and
the window was shut again and a young lady came across the court yard 
with keys in her hand 
 this said mr pumblechook is pip 
 this is pip is it returned the young lady who was very pretty and
seemed very proud come in pip 
mr pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate 
 oh she said did you wish to see miss havisham 
 if miss havisham wished to see me returned mr pumblechook 
discomfited 
 ah said the girl but you see she don t 
she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that mr 
pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not
protest but he eyed me severely as if i had done anything to
him and departed with the words reproachfully delivered boy let
your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand 
i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound
through the gate and sixteen but he didn t 
my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard 
it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice the
brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the
wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood
open away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused 
the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and
it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the
brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea 
she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt
all the strong beer that s brewed there now boy 
 i should think i could miss said i in a shy way 
 better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy 
don t you think so 
 it looks like it miss 
 not that anybody means to try she added for that s all done with 
and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls as to strong
beer there s enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor
house 
 is that the name of this house miss 
 one of its names boy 
 it has more than one then miss 
 one more its other name was satis which is greek or latin or
hebrew or all three or all one to me for enough 
 enough house said i that s a curious name miss 
 yes she replied but it meant more than it said it meant when it
was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else they
must have been easily satisfied in those days i should think but don t
loiter boy 
though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was
far from complimentary she was of about my own age she seemed much
older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and self possessed 
and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one and twenty and a
queen 
we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two
chains across it outside and the first thing i noticed was that the
passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there 
she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase 
and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us 
at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in 
i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss 
to this she returned don t be ridiculous boy i am not going in and
scornfully walked away and what was worse took the candle with her 
this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid however the only
thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told
from within to enter i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty
large room well lighted with wax candles no glimpse of daylight was to
be seen in it it was a dressing room as i supposed from the furniture 
though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me but
prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking glass and that
i made out at first sight to be a fine lady s dressing table 
whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
fine lady sitting at it i cannot say in an arm chair with an
elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the
strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see 
she was dressed in rich materials satins and lace and silks all
of white her shoes were white and she had a long white veil dependent
from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was
white some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and
some other jewels lay sparkling on the table dresses less splendid
than the dress she wore and half packed trunks were scattered about 
she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe on the
other was on the table near her hand her veil was but half arranged 
her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay
with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and
some flowers and a prayer book all confusedly heaped about the
looking glass 
it was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though
i saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed but i
saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been
white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow i saw
that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and
like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her
sunken eyes i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure
of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had
shrunk to skin and bone once i had been taken to see some ghastly
waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage
lying in state once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches
to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of
a vault under the church pavement now waxwork and skeleton seemed to
have dark eyes that moved and looked at me i should have cried out if
i could 
 who is it said the lady at the table 
 pip ma am 
 pip 
 mr pumblechook s boy ma am come to play 
 come nearer let me look at you come close 
it was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of
the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped
at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at
twenty minutes to nine 
 look at me said miss havisham you are not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born 
i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer no 
 do you know what i touch here she said laying her hands one upon
the other on her left side 
 yes ma am it made me think of the young man 
 what do i touch 
 your heart 
 broken 
she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and
with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it afterwards she kept
her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they
were heavy 
 i am tired said miss havisham i want diversion and i have done
with men and women play 
i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she
could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide
world more difficult to be done under the circumstances 
 i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy
that i want to see some play there there with an impatient movement
of the fingers of her right hand play play play 
for a moment with the fear of my sister s working me before my eyes i
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
of mr pumblechook s chaise cart but i felt myself so unequal to the
performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss havisham in
what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when
we had taken a good look at each other 
 are you sullen and obstinate 
 no ma am i am very sorry for you and very sorry i can t play just
now if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so
i would do it if i could but it s so new here and so strange and so
fine and melancholy i stopped fearing i might say too much or
had already said it and we took another look at each other 
before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the
dress she wore and at the dressing table and finally at herself in the
looking glass 
 so new to him she muttered so old to me so strange to him so
familiar to me so melancholy to both of us call estella 
as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was
still talking to herself and kept quiet 
 call estella she repeated flashing a look at me you can do that 
call estella at the door 
to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house 
bawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive 
and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost
as bad as playing to order but she answered at last and her light came
along the dark passage like a star 
miss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the
table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her
pretty brown hair your own one day my dear and you will use it
well let me see you play cards with this boy 
 with this boy why he is a common laboring boy 
i thought i overheard miss havisham answer only it seemed so
unlikely well you can break his heart 
 what do you play boy asked estella of myself with the greatest
disdain 
 nothing but beggar my neighbor miss 
 beggar him said miss havisham to estella so we sat down to cards 
it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago i noticed that
miss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had
taken it up as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressing table
again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never
been worn i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent 
and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been
trodden ragged without this arrest of everything this standing still
of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on
the collapsed form could have looked so like grave clothes or the long
veil so like a shroud 
so she sat corpse like as we played at cards the frillings and
trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper i knew nothing
then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
seen but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if
the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust 
 he calls the knaves jacks this boy said estella with disdain before
our first game was out and what coarse hands he has and what thick
boots 
i had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but i began
to consider them a very indifferent pair her contempt for me was so
strong that it became infectious and i caught it 
she won the game and i dealt i misdealt as was only natural when i
knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for
a stupid clumsy laboring boy 
 you say nothing of her remarked miss havisham to me as she looked
on she says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her what
do you think of her 
 i don t like to say i stammered 
 tell me in my ear said miss havisham bending down 
 i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper 
 anything else 
 i think she is very pretty 
 anything else 
 i think she is very insulting she was looking at me then with a look
of supreme aversion 
 anything else 
 i think i should like to go home 
 and never see her again though she is so pretty 
 i am not sure that i shouldn t like to see her again but i should like
to go home now 
 you shall go soon said miss havisham aloud play the game out 
saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost
sure that miss havisham s face could not smile it had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expression most likely when all the things about
her had become transfixed and it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice
had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her 
altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul 
within and without under the weight of a crushing blow 
i played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me she
threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she
despised them for having been won of me 
 when shall i have you here again said miss havisham let me think 
i was beginning to remind her that to day was wednesday when she
checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her
right hand 
 there there i know nothing of days of the week i know nothing of
weeks of the year come again after six days you hear 
 yes ma am 
 estella take him down let him have something to eat and let him roam
and look about him while he eats go pip 
i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she
stood it in the place where we had found it until she opened the
side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must
necessarily be night time the rush of the daylight quite confounded me 
and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room
many hours 
 you are to wait here you boy said estella and disappeared and
closed the door 
i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
coarse hands and my common boots my opinion of those accessories was
not favorable they had never troubled me before but they troubled
me now as vulgar appendages i determined to ask joe why he had ever
taught me to call those picture cards jacks which ought to be called
knaves i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then
i should have been so too 
she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer she
put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread
and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in
disgrace i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorry i
cannot hit upon the right name for the smart god knows what its name
was that tears started to my eyes the moment they sprang there the
girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them 
this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a
contemptuous toss but with a sense i thought of having made too sure
that i was so wounded and left me 
but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face
in and got behind one of the gates in the brewery lane and leaned my
sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried 
as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so
bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that
needed counteraction 
my sister s bringing up had made me sensitive in the little world in
which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is
nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice it may be
only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child
is small and its world is small and its rocking horse stands as many
hands high according to scale as a big boned irish hunter within
myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with
injustice i had known from the time when i could speak that my
sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me i had
cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her
no right to bring me up by jerks through all my punishments disgraces 
fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed
this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and
unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid
and very sensitive 
i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my
face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate the bread and meat
were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon
in spirits to look about me 
to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeon house in the
brewery yard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high
wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there
had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it but there were no pigeons
in the dove cot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in
the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat 
all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its
last reek of smoke in a by yard there was a wilderness of empty casks 
which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about
them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that
was gone and in this respect i remember those recluses as being like
most others 
behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old
wall not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough
to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the
house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was
a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked
there and that estella was walking away from me even then but she
seemed to be everywhere for when i yielded to the temptation presented
by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at
the end of the yard of casks she had her back towards me and held her
pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round 
and passed out of my view directly so in the brewery itself by which
i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer 
and where the brewing utensils still were when i first went into it 
and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about
me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light
iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going
out into the sky 
it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened
to my fancy i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a
stranger thing long afterwards i turned my eyes a little dimmed by
looking up at the frosty light towards a great wooden beam in a low
nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure
hanging there by the neck a figure all in yellow white with but
one shoe to the feet and it hung so that i could see that the faded
trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was
miss havisham s with a movement going over the whole countenance as if
she were trying to call to me in the terror of seeing the figure 
and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment
before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it and my terror
was greatest of all when i found no figure there 
nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the court yard gate and the reviving
influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought
me round even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon
as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to let
me out she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i
thought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason 
she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that
my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the
gate and stood holding it i was passing out without looking at her 
when she touched me with a taunting hand 
 why don t you cry 
 because i don t want to 
 you do said she you have been crying till you are half blind and
you are near crying again now 
she laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me 
i went straight to mr pumblechook s and was immensely relieved to find
him not at home so leaving word with the shopman on what day i was
wanted at miss havisham s again i set off on the four mile walk to
our forge pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply
revolving that i was a common laboring boy that my hands were coarse 
that my boots were thick that i had fallen into a despicable habit
of calling knaves jacks that i was much more ignorant than i had
considered myself last night and generally that i was in a low lived
bad way 
when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss
havisham s and asked a number of questions and i soon found myself
getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient length 
if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other
young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden
in mine which i consider probable as i have no particular reason
to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity it is the key to many
reservations i felt convinced that if i described miss havisham s as my
eyes had seen it i should not be understood not only that but i felt
convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood and although
she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression
that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging
her as she really was to say nothing of miss estella before the
contemplation of mrs joe consequently i said as little as i could 
and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall 
the worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by
a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came
gaping over in his chaise cart at tea time to have the details divulged
to him and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth
open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving
with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence 
 well boy uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the
chair of honor by the fire how did you get on up town 
i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me 
 pretty well mr pumblechook repeated pretty well is no answer tell
us what you mean by pretty well boy 
whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
perhaps anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my
obstinacy was adamantine i reflected for some time and then answered
as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well 
my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me i
had no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forge when mr 
pumblechook interposed with no don t lose your temper leave this
lad to me ma am leave this lad to me mr pumblechook then turned me
towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said 
 first to get our thoughts in order forty three pence 
i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and
finding them against me went as near the answer as i could which was
somewhere about eightpence off mr pumblechook then put me through my
pence table from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence
make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had
done for me now how much is forty three pence to which i replied 
after a long interval of reflection i don t know and i was so
aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know 
mr pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me 
and said is forty three pence seven and sixpence three fardens for
instance 
 yes said i and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was
highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and
brought him to a dead stop 
 boy what like is miss havisham mr pumblechook began again when
he had recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the
screw 
 very tall and dark i told him 
 is she uncle asked my sister 
mr pumblechook winked assent from which i at once inferred that he had
never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind 
 good said mr pumblechook conceitedly this is the way to have him 
we are beginning to hold our own i think mum 
 i am sure uncle returned mrs joe i wish you had him always you
know so well how to deal with him 
 now boy what was she a doing of when you went in today asked mr 
pumblechook 
 she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach 
mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one another as they well
might and both repeated in a black velvet coach 
 yes said i and miss estella that s her niece i think handed her
in cake and wine at the coach window on a gold plate and we all had
cake and wine on gold plates and i got up behind the coach to eat mine 
because she told me to 
 was anybody else there asked mr pumblechook 
 four dogs said i 
 large or small 
 immense said i and they fought for veal cutlets out of a silver
basket 
mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one another again in utter
amazement i was perfectly frantic a reckless witness under the
torture and would have told them anything 
 where was this coach in the name of gracious asked my sister 
 in miss havisham s room they stared again but there weren t any
horses to it i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting
four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of
harnessing 
 can this be possible uncle asked mrs joe what can the boy mean 
 i ll tell you mum said mr pumblechook my opinion is it s a
sedan chair she s flighty you know very flighty quite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedan chair 
 did you ever see her in it uncle asked mrs joe 
 how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see
her in my life never clapped eyes upon her 
 goodness uncle and yet you have spoken to her 
 why don t you know said mr pumblechook testily that when i have
been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door
has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way don t say you don t
know that mum howsever the boy went there to play what did you play
at boy 
 we played with flags i said i beg to observe that i think of myself
with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion 
 flags echoed my sister 
 yes said i estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and
miss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out
at the coach window and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed 
 swords repeated my sister where did you get swords from 
 out of a cupboard said i and i saw pistols in it and jam and
pills and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up
with candles 
 that s true mum said mr pumblechook with a grave nod that s the
state of the case for that much i ve seen myself and then they
both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers
with my right hand 
if they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery they were so much occupied however in discussing the
marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped 
the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to have a cup
of tea to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for
the gratification of his related my pretended experiences 
now when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence but only as
regarded him not in the least as regarded the other two towards
joe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat
debating what results would come to me from miss havisham s acquaintance
and favor they had no doubt that miss havisham would do something 
for me their doubts related to the form that something would take 
my sister stood out for property mr pumblechook was in favor of a
handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade say 
the corn and seed trade for instance joe fell into the deepest
disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only
be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal cutlets 
 if a fool s head can t express better opinions than that said my
sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it 
so he went 
after mr pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up 
i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had done for
the night then i said before the fire goes out joe i should like to
tell you something 
 should you pip said joe drawing his shoeing stool near the forge 
 then tell us what is it pip 
 joe said i taking hold of his rolled up shirt sleeve and twisting
it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss
havisham s 
 remember said joe i believe you wonderful 
 it s a terrible thing joe it ain t true 
 what are you telling of pip cried joe falling back in the greatest
amazement you don t mean to say it s 
 yes i do it s lies joe 
 but not all of it why sure you don t mean to say pip that there was
no black welwet co ch for i stood shaking my head but at least
there was dogs pip come pip said joe persuasively if there
warn t no weal cutlets at least there was dogs 
 no joe 
 a dog said joe a puppy come 
 no joe there was nothing at all of the kind 
as i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay 
 pip old chap this won t do old fellow i say where do you expect to
go to 
 it s terrible joe ain t it 
 terrible cried joe awful what possessed you 
 i don t know what possessed me joe i replied letting his shirt
sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head 
 but i wish you hadn t taught me to call knaves at cards jacks and i
wish my boots weren t so thick nor my hands so coarse 
and then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadn t been
able to explain myself to mrs joe and pumblechook who were so rude to
me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havisham s
who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i
knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies
had come of it somehow though i didn t know how 
this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal
with as for me but joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics and by that means vanquished it 
 there s one thing you may be sure of pip said joe after some
rumination namely that lies is lies howsever they come they didn t
ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to
the same don t you tell no more of em pip that ain t the way to get
out of being common old chap and as to being common i don t make
it out at all clear you are oncommon in some things you re oncommon
small likewise you re a oncommon scholar 
 no i am ignorant and backward joe 
 why see what a letter you wrote last night wrote in print even i ve
seen letters ah and from gentlefolks that i ll swear weren t wrote
in print said joe 
 i have learnt next to nothing joe you think much of me it s only
that 
 well pip said joe be it so or be it son t you must be a common
scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope the king upon
his throne with his crown upon his ed can t sit and write his acts
of parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted
prince with the alphabet ah added joe with a shake of the head
that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to z 
and i know what that is to do though i can t say i ve exactly done it 
there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged
me 
 whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued joe 
reflectively mightn t be the better of continuing for to keep
company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon
ones which reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps 
 no joe 
 i m sorry there weren t a flag pip whether that might be or
mightn t be is a thing as can t be looked into now without putting
your sister on the rampage and that s a thing not to be thought of as
being done intentional lookee here pip at what is said to you by a
true friend which this to you the true friend say if you can t get to
be oncommon through going straight you ll never get to do it through
going crooked so don t tell no more on em pip and live well and die
happy 
 you are not angry with me joe 
 no old chap but bearing in mind that them were which i meantersay
of a stunning and outdacious sort alluding to them which bordered on
weal cutlets and dog fighting a sincere well wisher would adwise pip 
their being dropped into your meditations when you go up stairs to bed 
that s all old chap and don t never do it no more 
when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget
joe s recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
unthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common
estella would consider joe a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and
how coarse his hands i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting
in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how
miss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the
level of such common doings i fell asleep recalling what i used to
do when i was at miss havisham s as though i had been there weeks or
months instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject of
remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day 
that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me but it
is the same with any life imagine one selected day struck out of it 
and think how different its course would have been pause you who read
this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold 
of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the
formation of the first link on one memorable day 
the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke 
that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to
get out of biddy everything she knew in pursuance of this luminous
conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to mr wopsle s great aunt s
at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life 
and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart
all her learning to me biddy who was the most obliging of girls 
immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise
within five minutes 
the educational scheme or course established by mr wopsle s great aunt
may be resolved into the following synopsis the pupils ate apples
and put straws down one another s backs until mr wopsle s great aunt
collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
a birch rod after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the
pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to
hand the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and
a little spelling that is to say it had had once as soon as this
volume began to circulate mr wopsle s great aunt fell into a state of
coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm the pupils then
entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject
of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon
whose toes this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at
them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been
unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed
at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with 
speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the
insect world smashed between their leaves this part of the course was
usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory
students when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a
page and then we all read aloud what we could or what we couldn t in
a frightful chorus biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice 
and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we
were reading about when this horrible din had lasted a certain time 
it mechanically awoke mr wopsle s great aunt who staggered at a boy
fortuitously and pulled his ears this was understood to terminate
the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of
intellectual victory it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition
against any pupil s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the
ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch
of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop
in which the classes were holden and which was also mr wopsle s
great aunt s sitting room and bedchamber being but faintly illuminated
through the agency of one low spirited dip candle and no snuffers 
it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under
these circumstances nevertheless i resolved to try it and that
very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some
information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist
sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english d which she
had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed 
until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle 
of course there was a public house in the village and of course joe
liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there i had received strict orders
from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that
evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril to the
three jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps 
there was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk
scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to
be never paid off they had been there ever since i could remember and
had grown more than i had but there was a quantity of chalk about our
country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
to account 
it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly
at these records but as my business was with joe and not with him i
merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the
end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire 
and where joe was smoking his pipe in company with mr wopsle and a
stranger joe greeted me as usual with halloa pip old chap and the
moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me 
he was a secret looking man whom i had never seen before his head was
all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were
taking aim at something with an invisible gun he had a pipe in his
mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away
and looking hard at me all the time nodded so i nodded and then he
nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit
down there 
but as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of
resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space joe made
for me on the opposite settle the strange man after glancing at joe 
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again
when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his leg in a very odd way as
it struck me 
 you was saying said the strange man turning to joe that you was a
blacksmith 
 yes i said it you know said joe 
 what ll you drink mr you didn t mention your name by the bye 
joe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it what ll you
drink mr gargery at my expense to top up with 
 well said joe to tell you the truth i ain t much in the habit of
drinking at anybody s expense but my own 
 habit no returned the stranger but once and away and on a
saturday night too come put a name to it mr gargery 
 i wouldn t wish to be stiff company said joe rum 
 rum repeated the stranger and will the other gentleman originate a
sentiment 
 rum said mr wopsle 
 three rums cried the stranger calling to the landlord glasses
round 
 this other gentleman observed joe by way of introducing mr wopsle 
 is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out our clerk at
church 
 aha said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me the
lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it 
 that s it said joe 
the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put
his legs up on the settle that he had to himself he wore a flapping
broad brimmed traveller s hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his
head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair as he looked
at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a
half laugh come into his face 
 i am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a
solitary country towards the river 
 most marshes is solitary said joe 
 no doubt no doubt do you find any gypsies now or tramps or
vagrants of any sort out there 
 no said joe none but a runaway convict now and then and we don t
find them easy eh mr wopsle 
mr wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented 
but not warmly 
 seems you have been out after such asked the stranger 
 once returned joe not that we wanted to take them you understand 
we went out as lookers on me and mr wopsle and pip didn t us pip 
 yes joe 
the stranger looked at me again still cocking his eye as if he were
expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun and said he s a
likely young parcel of bones that what is it you call him 
 pip said joe 
 christened pip 
 no not christened pip 
 surname pip 
 no said joe it s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
infant and is called by 
 son of yours 
 well said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in
anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at
the jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
discussed over pipes well no no he ain t 
 nevvy said the strange man 
 well said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he
is not no not to deceive you he is not my nevvy 
 what the blue blazes is he asked the stranger which appeared to me
to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength 
mr wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships 
having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
might not marry and expounded the ties between me and joe having
his hand in mr wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling
passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite
enough to account for it when he added as the poet says 
and here i may remark that when mr wopsle referred to me he considered
it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
my eyes i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited
at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory
process under similar circumstances yet i do not call to mind that i
was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family
circle but some large handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to
patronize me 
all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at
me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me
down but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation 
until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his
shot and a most extraordinary shot it was 
it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumb show and was
pointedly addressed to me he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me 
and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me and he stirred it and
he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file 
he did this so that nobody but i saw the file and when he had done it
he wiped the file and put it in a breast pocket i knew it to be
joe s file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the
instrument i sat gazing at him spell bound but he now reclined on his
settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about
turnips 
there was a delicious sense of cleaning up and making a quiet pause
before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights which
stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays
than at other times the half hour and the rum and water running out
together joe got up to go and took me by the hand 
 stop half a moment mr gargery said the strange man i think i ve
got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy
shall have it 
he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some
crumpled paper and gave it to me yours said he mind your own 
i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners 
and holding tight to joe he gave joe good night and he gave mr wopsle
good night who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his
aiming eye no not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done
with an eye by hiding it 
on the way home if i had been in a humor for talking the talk must
have been all on my side for mr wopsle parted from us at the door of
the jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide
open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible but i was in
a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
acquaintance and could think of nothing else 
my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
the kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell
her about the bright shilling a bad un i ll be bound said mrs joe
triumphantly or he wouldn t have given it to the boy let s look at
it 
i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one but what s
this said mrs joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the
paper two one pound notes 
nothing less than two fat sweltering one pound notes that seemed to have
been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle markets in
the county joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly
bargemen to restore them to their owner while he was gone i sat down
on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure
that the man would not be there 
presently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he 
joe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes 
then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under
some dried rose leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
the state parlor there they remained a nightmare to me many and many
a night and day 
i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the
strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily
coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with
convicts a feature in my low career that i had previously forgotten 
i was haunted by the file too a dread possessed me that when i least
expected it the file would reappear i coaxed myself to sleep by
thinking of miss havisham s next wednesday and in my sleep i saw
the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i
screamed myself awake 
at the appointed time i returned to miss havisham s and my hesitating
ring at the gate brought out estella she locked it after admitting
me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage
where her candle stood she took no notice of me until she had the
candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously
saying you are to come this way to day and took me to quite another
part of the house 
the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square
basement of the manor house we traversed but one side of the square 
however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and
opened a door here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in
a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a
detached dwelling house that looked as if it had once belonged to the
manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery there was a clock in the
outer wall of this house like the clock in miss havisham s room and
like miss havisham s watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine 
we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a
low ceiling on the ground floor at the back there was some company in
the room and estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and
stand there boy till you are wanted there being the window i
crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind 
looking out 
it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the
neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbage stalks and one box tree
that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new
growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different color as if
that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt this
was my homely thought as i contemplated the box tree there had been
some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge 
but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden 
and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window 
as if it pelted me for coming there 
i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that
its other occupants were looking at me i could see nothing of the room
except the shining of the fire in the window glass but i stiffened in
all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection 
there were three ladies in the room and one gentleman before i had been
standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that
they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not
to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission
that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady
and humbug 
they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody s pleasure 
and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded
me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found
when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features indeed when
i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had any features
at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face 
 poor dear soul said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my
sister s nobody s enemy but his own 
 it would be much more commendable to be somebody else s enemy said
the gentleman far more natural 
 cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbor 
 sarah pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own
neighbor who is 
miss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yawn 
 the idea but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good
idea too the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and
emphatically very true 
 poor soul camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking
at me in the mean time he is so very strange would anyone believe
that when tom s wife died he actually could not be induced to see the
importance of the children s having the deepest of trimmings to their
mourning good lord says he camilla what can it signify so long
as the poor bereaved little things are in black so like matthew the
idea 
 good points in him good points in him said cousin raymond heaven
forbid i should deny good points in him but he never had and he never
will have any sense of the proprieties 
 you know i was obliged said camilla i was obliged to be firm i
said it will not do for the credit of the family i told him that 
without deep trimmings the family was disgraced i cried about it from
breakfast till dinner i injured my digestion and at last he flung out
in his violent way and said with a d then do as you like thank
goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly
went out in a pouring rain and bought the things 
 he paid for them did he not asked estella 
 it s not the question my dear child who paid for them returned
camilla i bought them and i shall often think of that with peace 
when i wake up in the night 
the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or
call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation
and caused estella to say to me now boy on my turning round they
all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard
sarah pocket say well i am sure what next and camilla add with
indignation was there ever such a fancy the i de a 
as we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella stopped
all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with
her face quite close to mine 
 well 
 well miss i answered almost falling over her and checking myself 
she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her 
 am i pretty 
 yes i think you are very pretty 
 am i insulting 
 not so much so as you were last time said i 
 not so much so 
 no 
she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with
such force as she had when i answered it 
 now said she you little coarse monster what do you think of me
now 
 i shall not tell you 
 because you are going to tell up stairs is that it 
 no said i that s not it 
 why don t you cry again you little wretch 
 because i ll never cry for you again said i which was i suppose as
false a declaration as ever was made for i was inwardly crying for her
then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards 
we went on our way up stairs after this episode and as we were going
up we met a gentleman groping his way down 
 whom have we here asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me 
 a boy said estella 
he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an
exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand he took my chin
in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the
light of the candle he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and
had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn t lie down but stood up bristling 
his eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and
suspicious he had a large watch chain and strong black dots where his
beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them he was nothing
to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be
anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing
him well 
 boy of the neighborhood hey said he 
 yes sir said i 
 how do you come here 
 miss havisham sent for me sir i explained 
 well behave yourself i have a pretty large experience of boys and
you re a bad set of fellows now mind said he biting the side of his
great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself 
with those words he released me which i was glad of for his hand
smelt of scented soap and went his way down stairs i wondered whether
he could be a doctor but no i thought he couldn t be a doctor or he
would have a quieter and more persuasive manner there was not much time
to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havisham s room where
she and everything else were just as i had left them estella left me
standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham cast her
eyes upon me from the dressing table 
 so she said without being startled or surprised the days have worn
away have they 
 yes ma am to day is 
 there there there with the impatient movement of her fingers i
don t want to know are you ready to play 
i was obliged to answer in some confusion i don t think i am ma am 
 not at cards again she demanded with a searching look 
 yes ma am i could do that if i was wanted 
 since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss havisham 
impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work 
i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to
find for the other question and i said i was quite willing 
 then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind
me with her withered hand and wait there till i come 
i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated 
from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an
airless smell that was oppressive a fire had been lately kindled in
the damp old fashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than
to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder
than the clearer air like our own marsh mist certain wintry branches
of candles on the high chimney piece faintly lighted the chamber or it
would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness it was
spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible
thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces the
most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it 
as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all
stopped together an epergne or centre piece of some kind was in the
middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its
form was quite undistinguishable and as i looked along the yellow
expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black
fungus i saw speckle legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community 
i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests but the black beetles took
no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
elderly way as if they were short sighted and hard of hearing and not
on terms with one another 
these crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching
them from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder 
in her other hand she had a crutch headed stick on which she leaned and
she looked like the witch of the place 
 this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i
will be laid when i am dead they shall come and look at me here 
with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and
there and die at once the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork
at the fair i shrank under her touch 
 what do you think that is she asked me again pointing with her
stick that where those cobwebs are 
 i can t guess what it is ma am 
 it s a great cake a bride cake mine 
she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said 
leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come 
walk me walk me 
i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss
havisham round and round the room accordingly i started at once and
she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have
been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of mr 
pumblechook s chaise cart 
she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower 
still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she
twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to
believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast after a
while she said call estella so i went out on the landing and
roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion when her light
appeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round
and round the room 
if only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should
have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the
three ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didn t know
what to do in my politeness i would have stopped but miss
havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted on with a shame faced
consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing 
 dear miss havisham said miss sarah pocket how well you look 
 i do not returned miss havisham i am yellow skin and bone 
camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff and she
murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham poor dear
soul certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing the idea 
 and how are you said miss havisham to camilla as we were close to
camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss
havisham wouldn t stop we swept on and i felt that i was highly
obnoxious to camilla 
 thank you miss havisham she returned i am as well as can be
expected 
 why what s the matter with you asked miss havisham with exceeding
sharpness 
 nothing worth mentioning replied camilla i don t wish to make a
display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the
night than i am quite equal to 
 then don t think of me retorted miss havisham 
 very easily said remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a
hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed raymond is a
witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night 
raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs chokings
and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with
anxiety of those i love if i could be less affectionate and sensitive 
i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves i am sure
i wish it could be so but as to not thinking of you in the night the
idea here a burst of tears 
the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and
him i understood to be mr camilla he came to the rescue at this point 
and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice camilla my dear it
is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to
the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other 
 i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but
once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
person my dear 
miss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated
old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnut shells 
and a large mouth like a cat s without the whiskers supported this
position by saying no indeed my dear hem 
 thinking is easy enough said the grave lady 
 what is easier you know assented miss sarah pocket 
 oh yes yes cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to
rise from her legs to her bosom it s all very true it s a weakness
to be so affectionate but i can t help it no doubt my health would be
much better if it was otherwise still i wouldn t change my disposition
if i could it s the cause of much suffering but it s a consolation to
know i posses it when i wake up in the night here another burst of
feeling 
miss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going
round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the
visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber 
 there s matthew said camilla never mixing with any natural ties 
never coming here to see how miss havisham is i have taken to the sofa
with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head
over the side and my hair all down and my feet i don t know where 
 much higher than your head my love said mr camilla 
 i have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of
matthew s strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me 
 really i must say i should think not interposed the grave lady 
 you see my dear added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious
personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to
thank you my love 
 without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed
camilla i have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond
is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total
inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the piano forte
tuner s across the street where the poor mistaken children have even
supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance and now to be told 
here camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical
as to the formation of new combinations there 
when this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and
herself and stood looking at the speaker this change had a great
influence in bringing camilla s chemistry to a sudden end 
 matthew will come and see me at last said miss havisham sternly 
 when i am laid on that table that will be his place there striking
the table with her stick at my head and yours will be there and your
husband s there and sarah pocket s there and georgiana s there now
you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me 
and now go 
at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in
a new place she now said walk me walk me and we went on again 
 i suppose there s nothing to be done exclaimed camilla but comply
and depart it s something to have seen the object of one s love and
duty for even so short a time i shall think of it with a melancholy
satisfaction when i wake up in the night i wish matthew could have
that comfort but he sets it at defiance i am determined not to make a
display of my feelings but it s very hard to be told one wants to feast
on one s relations as if one was a giant and to be told to go the
bare idea 
mr camilla interposing as mrs camilla laid her hand upon her heaving
bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i
supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of
view and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth sarah
pocket and georgiana contended who should remain last but sarah was
too knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful
slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence sarah
pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss
havisham dear and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut shell
countenance for the weaknesses of the rest 
while estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked
with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly at last she
stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it
some seconds 
 this is my birthday pip 
i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick 
 i don t suffer it to be spoken of i don t suffer those who were here
just now or any one to speak of it they come here on the day but they
dare not refer to it 
of course i made no further effort to refer to it 
 on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of
decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table but not touching it was brought here it and i have worn away
together the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me 
she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking
at the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the
once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state
to crumble under a touch 
 when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when
they lay me dead in my bride s dress on the bride s table which shall
be done and which will be the finished curse upon him so much the
better if it is done on this day 
she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure
lying there i remained quiet estella returned and she too remained
quiet it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time in
the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its
remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i might
presently begin to decay 
at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an
instant miss havisham said let me see you two play cards why have
you not begun with that we returned to her room and sat down as
before i was beggared as before and again as before miss havisham
watched us all the time directed my attention to estella s beauty and
made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estella s breast and
hair 
estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she
did not condescend to speak when we had played some half dozen games 
a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard
to be fed in the former dog like manner there too i was again left to
wander about as i liked 
it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which
i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last
occasion open or shut enough that i saw no gate then and that i
saw one now as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let
the visitors out for she had returned with the keys in her hand i
strolled into the garden and strolled all over it it was quite a
wilderness and there were old melon frames and cucumber frames in it 
which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy
offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan 
when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but
a fallen down grape vine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal
corner upon which i had looked out of the window never questioning for
a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window 
and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a
pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair 
this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me 
he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him and i
now saw that he was inky 
 halloa said he young fellow 
halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to
be best answered by itself i said halloa politely omitting young
fellow 
 who let you in said he 
 miss estella 
 who gave you leave to prowl about 
 miss estella 
 come and fight said the pale young gentleman 
what could i do but follow him i have often asked myself the question
since but what else could i do his manner was so final and i was
so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a
spell 
 stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many
paces i ought to give you a reason for fighting too there it is 
in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one
another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair 
slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach 
the bull like proceeding last mentioned besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was
particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat i therefore hit out
at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha would you 
and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled
within my limited experience 
 laws of the game said he here he skipped from his left leg on to
his right regular rules here he skipped from his right leg on to
his left come to the ground and go through the preliminaries here 
he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i
looked helplessly at him 
i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous but i felt
morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have
had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to
consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention therefore i
followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by
the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish on his asking me
if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he begged my
leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle
of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar available for both he said 
placing these against the wall and then fell to pulling off not
only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once
light hearted business like and bloodthirsty 
although he did not look very healthy having pimples on his face and
a breaking out at his mouth these dreadful preparations quite appalled
me i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he
had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance for
the rest he was a young gentleman in a gray suit when not denuded
for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in
advance of the rest of him as to development 
my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were
minutely choosing his bone i never have been so surprised in my life 
as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his
back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly
fore shortened 
but he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with
a great show of dexterity began squaring again the second greatest
surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again 
looking up at me out of a black eye 
his spirit inspired me with great respect he seemed to have no
strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down 
but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out
of the water bottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made
me believe he really was going to do for me at last he got heavily
bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i
hit him but he came up again and again and again until at last he got
a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall even after that
crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a
few times not knowing where i was but finally went on his knees to his
sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out that means you
have won 
he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the
contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory indeed i go
so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of
savage young wolf or other wild beast however i got dressed darkly
wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you 
and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same
to you 
when i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys 
but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her
waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something
had happened to delight her instead of going straight to the gate too 
she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me 
 come here you may kiss me if you like 
i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me i think i would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her cheek but i felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and
that it was worth nothing 
what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with
the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light
on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against
a black night sky and joe s furnace was flinging a path of fire across
the road 
my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman the
more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on
his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the
more certain it appeared that something would be done to me i felt that
the pale young gentleman s blood was on my head and that the law would
avenge it without having any definite idea of the penalties i had
incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking
about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into
the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe
punishment for some days i even kept close at home and looked out at
the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going
on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon
me the pale young gentleman s nose had stained my trousers and i tried
to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night i had cut
my knuckles against the pale young gentleman s teeth and i twisted my
imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible ways of
accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before
the judges 
when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
violence my terrors reached their height whether myrmidons of justice 
specially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the
gate whether miss havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for
an outrage done to her house might rise in those grave clothes of hers 
draw a pistol and shoot me dead whether suborned boys a numerous
band of mercenaries might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery 
and cuff me until i was no more it was high testimony to my confidence
in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him
accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the
acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his
visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features 
however go to miss havisham s i must and go i did and behold nothing
came of the late struggle it was not alluded to in any way and no pale
young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises i found the same
gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the windows
of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
shutters within and all was lifeless only in the corner where
the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young
gentleman s existence there were traces of his gore in that spot and i
covered them with garden mould from the eye of man 
on the broad landing between miss havisham s own room and that other
room in which the long table was laid out i saw a garden chair a
light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind it had been placed
there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular
occupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired of
walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across
the landing and round the other room over and over and over again 
we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as
three hours at a stretch i insensibly fall into a general mention of
these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should
return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am
now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months 
as we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more
to me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was
i going to be i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i
believed and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
desirable end but she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer my
being ignorant neither did she ever give me any money or anything
but my daily dinner nor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my
services 
estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told
me i might kiss her again sometimes she would coldly tolerate me 
sometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite
familiar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she
hated me miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were
alone does she grow prettier and prettier pip and when i said yes
 for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily also when we
played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish of
estella s moods whatever they were and sometimes when her moods were
so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what
to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness 
murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their hearts my
pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy 
there was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the
burden was old clem this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation
towards smiths it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clem s
respected name thus you were to hammer boys round old clem with a
thump and a sound old clem beat it out beat it out old clem with a
clink for the stout old clem blow the fire blow the fire old
clem roaring dryer soaring higher old clem one day soon after the
appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly saying to me with the
impatient movement of her fingers there there there sing i was
surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor it
happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she were singing in her sleep after that it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about and estella would often
join in though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were
three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind 
what could i become with these surroundings how could my character fail
to be influenced by them is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light from the
misty yellow rooms 
perhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had
not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which
i had confessed under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly
fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger
to be put into the black velvet coach therefore i said nothing of him 
besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella discussed 
which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time
went on i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy but i told
poor biddy everything why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy
had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though
i think i know now 
meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit that ass 
pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister and i really do believe to
this hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise cart they would have done
it the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that
he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him as it
were to operate upon and he would drag me up from my stool usually
by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the
fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum 
here is this boy here is this boy which you brought up by hand hold up
your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do now 
mum with respections to this boy and then he would rumple my hair
the wrong way which from my earliest remembrance as already hinted 
i have in my soul denied the right of any fellow creature to do and
would hold me before him by the sleeve a spectacle of imbecility only
to be equalled by himself 
then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
about miss havisham and about what she would do with me and for me 
that i used to want quite painfully to burst into spiteful tears fly
at pumblechook and pummel him all over in these dialogues my sister
spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
every reference while pumblechook himself self constituted my patron 
would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of
my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job 
in these discussions joe bore no part but he was often talked at 
while they were in progress by reason of mrs joe s perceiving that
he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge i was fully old
enough now to be apprenticed to joe and when joe sat with the poker on
his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my
sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition
on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his
hands shake him and put it away there was a most irritating end to
every one of these debates all in a moment with nothing to lead up to
it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as
it were incidentally would swoop upon me with come there s enough of
you you get along to bed you ve given trouble enough for one night i
hope as if i had besought them as a favor to bother my life out 
we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we
should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss
havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my
shoulder and said with some displeasure 
 you are growing tall pip 
i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that
this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no control 
she said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me
again and presently again and after that looked frowning and moody 
on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and
i had landed her at her dressing table she stayed me with a movement of
her impatient fingers 
 tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours 
 joe gargery ma am 
 meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to 
 yes miss havisham 
 you had better be apprenticed at once would gargery come here with
you and bring your indentures do you think 
i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be
asked 
 then let him come 
 at any particular time miss havisham 
 there there i know nothing about times let him come soon and come
along with you 
when i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister
 went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous
period she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was door mats under
our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously
thought she was fit for when she had exhausted a torrent of such
inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud sobbing 
got out the dustpan which was always a very bad sign put on her
coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent not satisfied
with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbing brush and cleaned
us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the back yard 
it was ten o clock at night before we ventured to creep in again and
then she asked joe why he hadn t married a negress slave at once 
joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and
looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a
better speculation 
it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see
joe arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss
havisham s however as he thought his court suit necessary to the
occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his
working dress the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully
uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled
up his shirt collar so very high behind that it made the hair on the
crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers 
at breakfast time my sister declared her intention of going to town with
us and being left at uncle pumblechook s and called for when we had
done with our fine ladies a way of putting the case from which joe
appeared inclined to augur the worst the forge was shut up for the day 
and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on
the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable
hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
direction he had taken 
we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited
straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it
was a fine bright day i am not quite clear whether these articles were
carried penitentially or ostentatiously but i rather think they were
displayed as articles of property much as cleopatra or any other
sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or
procession 
when we came to pumblechook s my sister bounced in and left us as it
was almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havisham s house 
estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe took
his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands as if
he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a
quarter of an ounce 
estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew
so well i followed next to her and joe came last when i looked back
at joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the
greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
his toes 
estella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coat cuff
and conducted him into miss havisham s presence she was seated at her
dressing table and looked round at us immediately 
 oh said she to joe you are the husband of the sister of this boy 
i could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or
so like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with his
tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm 
 you are the husband repeated miss havisham of the sister of this
boy 
it was very aggravating but throughout the interview joe persisted in
addressing me instead of miss havisham 
 which i meantersay pip joe now observed in a manner that was at
once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great
politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time
what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man 
 well said miss havisham and you have reared the boy with the
intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so mr gargery 
 you know pip replied joe as you and me were ever friends and it
were looked for ard to betwixt us as being calc lated to lead to
larks not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the
business such as its being open to black and sut or such like not
but what they would have been attended to don t you see 
 has the boy said miss havisham ever made any objection does he
like the trade 
 which it is well beknown to yourself pip returned joe strengthening
his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that
it were the wish of your own hart i saw the idea suddenly break upon
him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on
to say and there weren t no objection on your part and pip it were
the great wish of your hart 
it was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he
ought to speak to miss havisham the more i made faces and gestures
to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he
persisted in being to me 
 have you brought his indentures with you asked miss havisham 
 well pip you know replied joe as if that were a little
unreasonable you yourself see me put em in my at and therefore you
know as they are here with which he took them out and gave them not
to miss havisham but to me i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good
fellow i know i was ashamed of him when i saw that estella stood
at the back of miss havisham s chair and that her eyes laughed
mischievously i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to
miss havisham 
 you expected said miss havisham as she looked them over no premium
with the boy 
 joe i remonstrated for he made no reply at all why don t you
answer 
 pip returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which i
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
and me and which you know the answer to be full well no you know it to
be no pip and wherefore should i say it 
miss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there and took
up a little bag from the table beside her 
 pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is there are
five and twenty guineas in this bag give it to your master pip 
as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in
him by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass 
persisted in addressing me 
 this is wery liberal on your part pip said joe and it is as such
received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near 
nor nowheres and now old chap said joe conveying to me a sensation 
first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar
expression were applied to miss havisham and now old chap may we
do our duty may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another 
and by them which your liberal present have conweyed to be for the
satisfaction of mind of them as never here joe showed that he felt
he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued
himself with the words and from myself far be it these words had
such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice 
 good by pip said miss havisham let them out estella 
 am i to come again miss havisham i asked 
 no gargery is your master now gargery one word 
thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe
in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and
that is his reward of course as an honest man you will expect no
other and no more 
how joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine but
i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding up stairs
instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went
after him and laid hold of him in another minute we were outside the
gate and it was locked and estella was gone when we stood in the
daylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me 
 astonishing and there he remained so long saying astonishing at
intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming
back at length he prolonged his remark into pip i do assure you this
is as ton ishing and so by degrees became conversational and able to
walk away 
i have reason to think that joe s intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechook s
he invented a subtle and deep design my reason is to be found in
what took place in mr pumblechook s parlor where on our presenting
ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman 
 well cried my sister addressing us both at once and what s
happened to you i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor
society as this i am sure i do 
 miss havisham said joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of
remembrance made it wery partick ler that we should give her were it
compliments or respects pip 
 compliments i said 
 which that were my own belief answered joe her compliments to mrs 
j gargery 
 much good they ll do me observed my sister but rather gratified too 
 and wishing pursued joe with another fixed look at me like another
effort of remembrance that the state of miss havisham s elth were
sitch as would have allowed were it pip 
 of her having the pleasure i added 
 of ladies company said joe and drew a long breath 
 well cried my sister with a mollified glance at mr pumblechook 
 she might have had the politeness to send that message at first but
it s better late than never and what did she give young rantipole
here 
 she giv him said joe nothing 
mrs joe was going to break out but joe went on 
 what she giv said joe she giv to his friends and by his
friends were her explanation i mean into the hands of his sister
mrs j gargery them were her words mrs j gargery she mayn t
have know d added joe with an appearance of reflection whether it
were joe or jorge 
my sister looked at pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden
arm chair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all
about it beforehand 
 and how much have you got asked my sister laughing positively
laughing 
 what would present company say to ten pound demanded joe 
 they d say returned my sister curtly pretty well not too much 
but pretty well 
 it s more than that then said joe 
that fearful impostor pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he
rubbed the arms of his chair it s more than that mum 
 why you don t mean to say began my sister 
 yes i do mum said pumblechook but wait a bit go on joseph good
in you go on 
 what would present company say proceeded joe to twenty pound 
 handsome would be the word returned my sister 
 well then said joe it s more than twenty pound 
that abject hypocrite pumblechook nodded again and said with a
patronizing laugh it s more than that mum good again follow her up 
joseph 
 then to make an end of it said joe delightedly handing the bag to my
sister it s five and twenty pound 
 it s five and twenty pound mum echoed that basest of swindlers 
pumblechook rising to shake hands with her and it s no more than your
merits as i said when my opinion was asked and i wish you joy of the
money 
if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently
awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody 
with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far
behind 
 now you see joseph and wife said pumblechook as he took me by the
arm above the elbow i am one of them that always go right through with
what they ve begun this boy must be bound out of hand that s my way 
bound out of hand 
 goodness knows uncle pumblechook said my sister grasping the
money we re deeply beholden to you 
 never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler a
pleasure s a pleasure all the world over but this boy you know we
must have him bound i said i d see to it to tell you the truth 
the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to joe in the magisterial
presence i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook 
exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed 
it was the general impression in court that i had been taken red handed 
for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some
people say what s he done and others he s a young un too but
looks bad don t he one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave
me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted
up with a perfect sausage shop of fetters and entitled to be read in my
cell 
the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a
church and with people hanging over the pews looking on and with
mighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with
folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading
the newspapers and with some shining black portraits on the walls 
which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
sticking plaster here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
attested and i was bound mr pumblechook holding me all the while
as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little
preliminaries disposed of 
when we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put
into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured 
and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely
rallying round me we went back to pumblechook s and there my sister
became so excited by the twenty five guineas that nothing would serve
her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue boar and
that pumblechook must go over in his chaise cart and bring the hubbles
and mr wopsle 
it was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day i passed for 
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole
company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment and to make it
worse they all asked me from time to time in short whenever they
had nothing else to do why i didn t enjoy myself and what could i
possibly do then but say i was enjoying myself when i wasn t 
however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the
most of it that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent
contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table 
and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had
fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i
played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company 
or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair
beside him to illustrate his remarks 
my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldn t
let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up
and told me to enjoy myself that rather late in the evening mr wopsle
gave us collins s ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder
down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials
underneath sent up their compliments and it wasn t the tumblers arms 
that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang o
lady fair mr wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously
strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece
of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about
everybody s private affairs that he was the man with his white locks
flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going 
finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly
wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like
joe s trade i had liked it once but once was not now 
it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home there may be black
ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well
deserved but that it is a miserable thing i can testify 
home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sister s
temper but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it i had
believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon i had believed
in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose
solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls i had
believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment 
i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and
independence within a single year all this was changed now it was all
coarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella
see it on any account 
how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault 
how much miss havisham s how much my sister s is now of no moment to
me or to any one the change was made in me the thing was done well or
ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done 
once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my
shirt sleeves and go into the forge joe s prentice i should be
distinguished and happy now the reality was in my hold i only felt
that i was dusty with the dust of small coal and that i had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather there have
been occasions in my later life i suppose as in most lives when i have
felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more 
never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in
life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road
of apprenticeship to joe 
i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about
the churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my
own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness
between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both
there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea i was quite
as dejected on the first working day of my apprenticeship as in that
after time but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe
while my indentures lasted it is about the only thing i am glad to know
of myself in that connection 
for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i
proceed to add was joe s it was not because i was faithful but because
joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or
a sailor it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of
industry but because joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry 
that i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain it is not possible
to know how far the influence of any amiable honest hearted duty doing
man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has
touched one s self in going by and i know right well that any good that
intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented joe 
and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me 
what i wanted who can say how can i say when i never knew what
i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and
commonest should lift up my eyes and see estella looking in at one
of the wooden windows of the forge i was haunted by the fear that she
would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing
the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me 
often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were
singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss
havisham s would seem to show me estella s face in the fire with her
pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me often at
such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall
which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her just
drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last 
after that when we went in to supper the place and the meal would have
a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of home than
ever in my own ungracious breast 
as i was getting too big for mr wopsle s great aunt s room my
education under that preposterous female terminated not however until
biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue
of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a half penny 
although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were
the opening lines 
when i went to lunnon town sirs too rul loo rul too rul loo rul wasn t
i done very brown sirs too rul loo rul too rul loo rul still in
my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost
gravity nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i
thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the
poetry in my hunger for information i made proposals to mr wopsle to
bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied 
as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic
lay figure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied
and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways i soon
declined that course of instruction though not until mr wopsle in his
poetic fury had severely mauled me 
whatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe this statement sounds so
well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained i wanted
to make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my
society and less open to estella s reproach 
the old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken
slate and a short piece of slate pencil were our educational implements 
to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco i never knew joe to
remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my
tuition any piece of information whatever yet he would smoke his pipe
at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else even
with a learned air as if he considered himself to be advancing
immensely dear fellow i hope he did 
it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing
beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking
as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the
bottom of the water whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea
with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss havisham and
estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud
or sail or green hillside or water line it was just the same miss
havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared
to have something to do with everything that was picturesque 
one sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on
being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on
the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of
miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the
water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them
that had been much in my head 
 joe said i don t you think i ought to make miss havisham a visit 
 well pip returned joe slowly considering what for 
 what for joe what is any visit made for 
 there is some wisits p r aps said joe as for ever remains open to
the question pip but in regard to wisiting miss havisham she might
think you wanted something expected something of her 
 don t you think i might say that i did not joe 
 you might old chap said joe and she might credit it similarly she
mightn t 
joe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard
at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition 
 you see pip joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss
havisham done the handsome thing by you when miss havisham done the
handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were
all 
 yes joe i heard her 
 all joe repeated very emphatically 
 yes joe i tell you i heard her 
 which i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning were make a
end on it as you was me to the north and you to the south keep in
sunders 
i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me
to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more
probable 
 but joe 
 yes old chap 
 here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day
of my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after
her or shown that i remember her 
 that s true pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes
all four round and which i meantersay as even a set of shoes all
four round might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of
hoofs 
 i don t mean that sort of remembrance joe i don t mean a present 
but joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it 
 or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain
for the front door or say a gross or two of shark headed screws for
general use or some light fancy article such as a toasting fork
when she took her muffins or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such
like 
 i don t mean any present at all joe i interposed 
 well said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly
pressed it if i was yourself pip i wouldn t no i would not for
what s a door chain when she s got one always up and shark headers is
open to misrepresentations and if it was a toasting fork you d go into
brass and do yourself no credit and the oncommonest workman can t show
himself oncommon in a gridiron for a gridiron is a gridiron said
joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to
rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but
a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave 
and you can t help yourself 
 my dear joe i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat don t
go on in that way i never thought of making miss havisham any present 
 no pip joe assented as if he had been contending for that all
along and what i say to you is you are right pip 
 yes joe but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack
just now if you would give me a half holiday to morrow i think i would
go up town and make a call on miss est havisham 
 which her name said joe gravely ain t estavisham pip unless she
have been rechris ened 
 i know joe i know it was a slip of mine what do you think of it 
joe 
in brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of
it but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received
with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a
favor received then this experimental trip should have no successor by
these conditions i promised to abide 
now joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick 
he pretended that his christian name was dolge a clear
impossibility but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i
believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but
wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its
understanding he was a broadshouldered loose limbed swarthy fellow of
great strength never in a hurry and always slouching he never even
seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere
accident and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his dinner or
went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew 
as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever
coming back he lodged at a sluice keeper s out on the marshes and on
working days would come slouching from his hermitage with his hands in
his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck
and dangling on his back on sundays he mostly lay all day on the
sluice gates or stood against ricks and barns he always slouched 
locomotively with his eyes on the ground and when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a half resentful 
half puzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it
was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking 
this morose journeyman had no liking for me when i was very small and
timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner
of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was
necessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy and
that i might consider myself fuel when i became joe s prentice orlick
was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him 
howbeit he liked me still less not that he ever said anything or did
anything openly importing hostility i only noticed that he always beat
his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came
in out of time 
dolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of
my half holiday he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just
got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows but by
and by he said leaning on his hammer 
 now master sure you re not a going to favor only one of us if young
pip has a half holiday do as much for old orlick i suppose he was
about five and twenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient
person 
 why what ll you do with a half holiday if you get it said joe 
 what ll i do with it what ll he do with it i ll do as much with it as
him said orlick 
 as to pip he s going up town said joe 
 well then as to old orlick he s a going up town retorted that
worthy two can go up town tain t only one wot can go up town 
 don t lose your temper said joe 
 shall if i like growled orlick some and their up towning now 
master come no favoring in this shop be a man 
the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in
a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a red hot
bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body 
whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it out as
if it were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting blood and
finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he
again leaned on his hammer 
 now master 
 are you all right now demanded joe 
 ah i am all right said gruff old orlick 
 then as in general you stick to your work as well as most men said
joe let it be a half holiday for all 
my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearing she was
a most unscrupulous spy and listener and she instantly looked in at
one of the windows 
 like you you fool said she to joe giving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in
that way i wish i was his master 
 you d be everybody s master if you durst retorted orlick with an
ill favored grin 
 let her alone said joe 
 i d be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister 
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage and i couldn t be a
match for the noodles without being a match for your master who s the
dunder headed king of the noodles and i couldn t be a match for the
rogues without being a match for you who are the blackest looking and
the worst rogue between this and france now 
 you re a foul shrew mother gargery growled the journeyman if that
makes a judge of rogues you ought to be a good un 
 let her alone will you said joe 
 what did you say cried my sister beginning to scream what did you
say what did that fellow orlick say to me pip what did he call me 
with my husband standing by oh oh oh each of these exclamations was
a shriek and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of all
the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for
her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she
consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
into it and became blindly furious by regular stages what was the
name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me oh hold me 
oh 
 ah h h growled the journeyman between his teeth i d hold you if
you was my wife i d hold you under the pump and choke it out of you 
 i tell you let her alone said joe 
 oh to hear him cried my sister with a clap of her hands and a
scream together which was her next stage to hear the names he s
giving me that orlick in my own house me a married woman with my
husband standing by oh oh here my sister after a fit of clappings
and screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and
threw her cap off and pulled her hair down which were the last stages
on her road to frenzy being by this time a perfect fury and a complete
success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked 
what could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical
interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant
by interfering betwixt himself and mrs joe and further whether he was
man enough to come on old orlick felt that the situation admitted of
nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway so 
without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went
at one another like two giants but if any man in that neighborhood
could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man orlick as if he
had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very
soon among the coal dust and in no hurry to come out of it then joe
unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible
at the window but who had seen the fight first i think and who was
carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive 
and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in joe s hair 
then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars and
then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such
a lull namely that it was sunday and somebody was dead i went up
stairs to dress myself 
when i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any
other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlick s nostrils 
which was neither expressive nor ornamental a pot of beer had appeared
from the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a
peaceable manner the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on
joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation
that might do me good on the rampage pip and off the rampage 
pip such is life 
with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very
serious in a man quite comical in a boy i found myself again going to
miss havisham s matters little here nor how i passed and repassed
the gate many times before i could make up my mind to ring nor how
i debated whether i should go away without ringing nor how i should
undoubtedly have gone if my time had been my own to come back 
miss sarah pocket came to the gate no estella 
 how then you here again said miss pocket what do you want 
when i said that i only came to see how miss havisham was sarah
evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my
business but unwilling to hazard the responsibility she let me in and
presently brought the sharp message that i was to come up 
everything was unchanged and miss havisham was alone 
 well said she fixing her eyes upon me i hope you want nothing 
you ll get nothing 
 no indeed miss havisham i only wanted you to know that i am doing
very well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to you 
 there there with the old restless fingers come now and then come
on your birthday ay she cried suddenly turning herself and her
chair towards me you are looking round for estella hey 
i had been looking round in fact for estella and i stammered that i
hoped she was well 
 abroad said miss havisham educating for a lady far out of reach 
prettier than ever admired by all who see her do you feel that you
have lost her 
there was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words 
and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that i was at a loss what
to say she spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me when
the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the walnut shell countenance i
felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with
everything and that was all i took by that motion 
as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at
the shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman 
who should come out of the bookshop but mr wopsle mr wopsle had in
his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that
moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on
the head of pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea no sooner
did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence
had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me 
and insisted on my accompanying him to the pumblechookian parlor as i
knew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the
way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better
than none i made no great resistance consequently we turned into
pumblechook s just as the street and the shops were lighting up 
as i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i
don t know how long it may usually take but i know very well that it
took until half past nine o clock that night and that when mr wopsle
got into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he became
so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career i
thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short
in his flower after all as if he had not been running to seed leaf
after leaf ever since his course began this however was a
mere question of length and wearisomeness what stung me was the
identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self when
barnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively apologetic 
pumblechook s indignant stare so taxed me with it wopsle too took
pains to present me in the worst light at once ferocious and maudlin i
was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever 
millwood put me down in argument on every occasion it became sheer
monomania in my master s daughter to care a button for me and all i can
say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning is 
that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character even after
i was happily hanged and wopsle had closed the book pumblechook sat
staring at me and shaking his head and saying take warning boy 
take warning as if it were a well known fact that i contemplated
murdering a near relation provided i could only induce one to have the
weakness to become my benefactor 
it was a very dark night when it was all over and when i set out with
mr wopsle on the walk home beyond town we found a heavy mist out and
it fell wet and thick the turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of the
lamp s usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance on
the fog we were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose with a
change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes when we came upon
a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house 
 halloa we said stopping orlick there 
 ah he answered slouching out i was standing by a minute on the
chance of company 
 you are late i remarked 
orlick not unnaturally answered well and you re late 
 we have been said mr wopsle exalted with his late performance we
have been indulging mr orlick in an intellectual evening 
old orlick growled as if he had nothing to say about that and we all
went on together i asked him presently whether he had been spending his
half holiday up and down town 
 yes said he all of it i come in behind yourself i didn t see you 
but i must have been pretty close behind you by the by the guns is
going again 
 at the hulks said i 
 ay there s some of the birds flown from the cages the guns have been
going since dark about you ll hear one presently 
in effect we had not walked many yards further when the
well remembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily
rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing
and threatening the fugitives 
 a good night for cutting off in said orlick we d be puzzled how to
bring down a jail bird on the wing to night 
the subject was a suggestive one to me and i thought about it in
silence mr wopsle as the ill requited uncle of the evening s tragedy 
fell to meditating aloud in his garden at camberwell orlick with his
hands in his pockets slouched heavily at my side it was very dark 
very wet very muddy and so we splashed along now and then the sound
of the signal cannon broke upon us again and again rolled sulkily along
the course of the river i kept myself to myself and my thoughts mr 
wopsle died amiably at camberwell and exceedingly game on bosworth
field and in the greatest agonies at glastonbury orlick sometimes
growled beat it out beat it out old clem with a clink for the
stout old clem i thought he had been drinking but he was not drunk 
thus we came to the village the way by which we approached it took us
past the three jolly bargemen which we were surprised to find it being
eleven o clock in a state of commotion with the door wide open and
unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered
about mr wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter surmising that
a convict had been taken but came running out in a great hurry 
 there s something wrong said he without stopping up at your place 
pip run all 
 what is it i asked keeping up with him so did orlick at my side 
 i can t quite understand the house seems to have been violently
entered when joe gargery was out supposed by convicts somebody has
been attacked and hurt 
we were running too fast to admit of more being said and we made no
stop until we got into our kitchen it was full of people the whole
village was there or in the yard and there was a surgeon and there
was joe and there were a group of women all on the floor in the midst
of the kitchen the unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me 
and so i became aware of my sister lying without sense or movement on
the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow
on the back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face was
turned towards the fire destined never to be on the rampage again 
while she was the wife of joe 
with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe
that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at
all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under
obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to
reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides i
took another view of the case which was more reasonable 
joe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a
quarter after eight o clock to a quarter before ten while he was there 
my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged
good night with a farm laborer going home the man could not be more
particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense
confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine 
when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down
on the floor and promptly called in assistance the fire had not then
burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long the
candle however had been blown out 
nothing had been taken away from any part of the house neither beyond
the blowing out of the candle which stood on a table between the door
and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was
struck was there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such
as she herself had made in falling and bleeding but there was one
remarkable piece of evidence on the spot she had been struck with
something blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were
dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable
violence as she lay on her face and on the ground beside her when joe
picked her up was a convict s leg iron which had been filed asunder 
now joe examining this iron with a smith s eye declared it to have
been filed asunder some time ago the hue and cry going off to the
hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joe s opinion
was corroborated they did not undertake to say when it had left the
prison ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed
to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by
either of the two convicts who had escaped last night further one of
those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron 
knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here i believed
the iron to be my convict s iron the iron i had seen and heard him
filing at on the marshes but my mind did not accuse him of having put
it to its latest use for i believed one of two other persons to have
become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account 
either orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file 
now as to orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we
picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the
evening he had been in divers companies in several public houses and
he had come back with myself and mr wopsle there was nothing against
him save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with
everybody else about her ten thousand times as to the strange man if
he had come back for his two bank notes there could have been no dispute
about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them 
besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so
silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look
round 
it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however
undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise i suffered unspeakable
trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last
dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the story for
months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the
negative and reopened and reargued it next morning the contention
came after all to this the secret was such an old one now had so
grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it
away in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief 
it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me if he
believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe
it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal cutlets as a
monstrous invention however i temporized with myself of course for 
was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always
done and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any
such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the
assailant 
the constables and the bow street men from london for this happened in
the days of the extinct red waistcoated police were about the house for
a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like
authorities doing in other such cases they took up several obviously
wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas 
and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead
of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances also they stood
about the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks
that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration and they had a
mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as
taking the culprit but not quite for they never did it 
long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very
ill in bed her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied 
and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the
realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her
speech was unintelligible when at last she came round so far as to
be helped down stairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by
her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in
speech as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent
speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary
complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve 
the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of
tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own
mistakes 
however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient a
tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a
part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three
months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain
for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind we were
at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance
happened conveniently to relieve us mr wopsle s great aunt conquered a
confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a
part of our establishment 
it may have been about a month after my sister s reappearance in the
kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household 
above all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly
cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had
been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me
every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened such a fine
figure of a woman as she once were pip biddy instantly taking the
cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy joe
became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life 
and to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that did
him good it was characteristic of the police people that they had all
more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew it and that they
had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits
they had ever encountered 
biddy s first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me i had tried hard at it but had made
nothing of it thus it was 
again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a
character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly
wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t 
from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the
sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my
sister s ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a
qualified assent thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after
another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape
being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed
it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to
that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her
weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck 
when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this
mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully
at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked
thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his
initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me 
 why of course cried biddy with an exultant face don t you see 
it s him 
orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify
him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into the
kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his
arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching
out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly
distinguished him 
i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i
was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his
being at length produced and motioned that she would have him
given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were
particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception 
she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air
of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the
bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely
passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlick s
slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more
than i did what to make of it 
i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was
varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying
another visit to miss havisham i found miss sarah pocket still on duty
at the gate i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she spoke
of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words the
interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was
going and told me to come again on my next birthday i may mention at
once that this became an annual custom i tried to decline taking the
guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her
to ask me very angrily if i expected more then and after that i took
it 
so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened
room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing table glass that
i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that
mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew
older it stood still daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact it
bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my
trade and to be ashamed of home 
imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however her
shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were
always clean she was not beautiful she was common and could not be
like estella but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet tempered 
she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly
out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one
evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes that
were very pretty and very good 
it came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring
at writing some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagem and seeing biddy observant of what i was
about i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without
laying it down 
 biddy said i how do you manage it either i am very stupid or you
are very clever 
 what is it that i manage i don t know returned biddy smiling 
she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not
mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising 
 how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn 
and always to keep up with me i was beginning to be rather vain of
my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the
greater part of my pocket money for similar investment though i have no
doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price 
 i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage 
 no because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see
me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy 
 i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly and went
on with her sewing 
pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at
biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather
an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally
accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different
sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy
knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or
better 
 you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every
chance you never had a chance before you came here and see how
improved you are 
biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing i was
your first teacher though wasn t i said she as she sewed 
 biddy i exclaimed in amazement why you are crying 
 no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing what put that in
your head 
what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her work i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been
until mr wopsle s great aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalled
the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the
miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school 
with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must
have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first
uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of
course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i
looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps
i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too
reserved and should have patronized her more though i did not use that
precise word in my meditations with my confidence 
 yes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over you were my
first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
together like this in this kitchen 
 ah poor thing replied biddy it was like her self forgetfulness to
transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her 
making her more comfortable that s sadly true 
 well said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do 
and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a
quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat 
my sister was never left alone now but joe more than readily undertook
the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out
together it was summer time and lovely weather when we had passed the
village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes
and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to
combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my usual way 
when we came to the river side and sat down on the bank with the water
rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been
without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the
admission of biddy into my inner confidence 
 biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a
gentleman 
 o i wouldn t if i was you she returned i don t think it would
answer 
 biddy said i with some severity i have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman 
 you know best pip but don t you think you are happier as you are 
 biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am i
am disgusted with my calling and with my life i have never taken to
either since i was bound don t be absurd 
 was i absurd said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows i am sorry
for that i didn t mean to be i only want you to do well and to be
comfortable 
 well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be
comfortable or anything but miserable there biddy unless i can lead
a very different sort of life from the life i lead now 
 that s a pity said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air 
now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of
quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined
to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her
sentiment and my own i told her she was right and i knew it was much
to be regretted but still it was not to be helped 
 if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short
grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings
out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall if i could have
settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was
little i know it would have been much better for me you and i and joe
would have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone
partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to
keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
sunday quite different people i should have been good enough for you 
shouldn t i biddy 
biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for
answer yes i am not over particular it scarcely sounded flattering 
but i knew she meant well 
 instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
two see how i am going on dissatisfied and uncomfortable and what
would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me
so 
biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more
attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships 
 it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she
remarked directing her eyes to the ships again who said it 
i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where
i was going to it was not to be shuffled off now however and i
answered the beautiful young lady at miss havisham s and she s more
beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want
to be a gentleman on her account having made this lunatic confession 
i began to throw my torn up grass into the river as if i had some
thoughts of following it 
 do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over biddy
quietly asked me after a pause 
 i don t know i moodily answered 
 because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should think but
you know best that might be better and more independently done by
caring nothing for her words and if it is to gain her over i should
think but you know best she was not worth gaining over 
exactly what i myself had thought many times exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment but how could i a poor dazed
village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and
wisest of men fall every day 
 it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her
dreadfully 
in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good
grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well all the
while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced 
that i was quite conscious it would have served my face right if i
had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a
punishment for belonging to such an idiot 
biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me 
she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work 
upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair 
then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face
upon my sleeve i cried a little exactly as i had done in the brewery
yard and felt vaguely convinced that i was very much ill used by
somebody or by everybody i can t say which 
 i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt
you could give me your confidence pip and i am glad of another thing 
and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it
and always so far deserving it if your first teacher dear such a poor
one and so much in need of being taught herself had been your teacher
at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set but
it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and it s
of no use now so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank 
and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a
little farther or go home 
 biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving
her a kiss i shall always tell you everything 
 till you re a gentleman said biddy 
 you know i never shall be so that s always not that i have any
occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i know as i
told you at home the other night 
 ah said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships 
and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a
little farther or go home 
i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the
summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very
beautiful i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and
wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing
beggar my neighbor by candle light in the room with the stopped clocks 
and being despised by estella i thought it would be very good for me if
i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances
and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do 
and stick to it and make the best of it i asked myself the question
whether i did not surely know that if estella were beside me at that
moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable i was obliged to
admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself pip 
what a fool you are 
we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed
right biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy to day and
somebody else to morrow she would have derived only pain and no
pleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own
breast than mine how could it be then that i did not like her much
the better of the two 
 biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me
right 
 i wish i could said biddy 
 if i could only get myself to fall in love with you you don t mind my
speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance 
 oh dear not at all said biddy don t mind me 
 if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me 
 but you never will you see said biddy 
it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have
done if we had discussed it a few hours before i therefore observed
i was not quite sure of that but biddy said she was and she said it
decisively in my heart i believed her to be right and yet i took it
rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point 
when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and
get over a stile near a sluice gate there started up from the gate or
from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way 
old orlick 
 halloa he growled where are you two going 
 where should we be going but home 
 well then said he i m jiggered if i don t see you home 
this penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of
his he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but
used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and
convey an idea of something savagely damaging when i was younger i
had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would
have done it with a sharp and twisted hook 
biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper 
 don t let him come i don t like him as i did not like him either 
i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didn t want
seeing home he received that piece of information with a yell of
laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little
distance 
curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in
that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
account i asked her why she did not like him 
 oh she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us 
 because i i am afraid he likes me 
 did he ever tell you he liked you i asked indignantly 
 no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me
so but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye 
however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not
doubt the accuracy of the interpretation i was very hot indeed upon
old orlick s daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on
myself 
 but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly 
 no biddy it makes no difference to me only i don t like it i don t
approve of it 
 nor i neither said biddy though that makes no difference to you 
 exactly said i but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you 
biddy if he danced at you with your own consent 
i kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances
were favorable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that
demonstration he had struck root in joe s establishment by reason
of my sister s sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him
dismissed he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i
had reason to know thereafter 
and now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated
its confusion fifty thousand fold by having states and seasons when i
was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the
plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to
be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of self respect
and happiness at those times i would decide conclusively that my
disaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was
growing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company
with biddy when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the
havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter
my wits again scattered wits take a long time picking up and often
before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all
directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss havisham
was going to make my fortune when my time was out 
if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my
perplexities i dare say it never did run out however but was brought
to a premature end as i proceed to relate 
it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a
saturday night there was a group assembled round the fire at the three
jolly bargemen attentive to mr wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud 
of that group i was one 
a highly popular murder had been committed and mr wopsle was imbrued
in blood to the eyebrows he gloated over every abhorrent adjective
in the description and identified himself with every witness at the
inquest he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he
barbarously bellowed i ll serve you out as the murderer he gave the
medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner and
he piped and shook as the aged turnpike keeper who had heard blows to
an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental
competency of that witness the coroner in mr wopsle s hands became
timon of athens the beadle coriolanus he enjoyed himself thoroughly 
and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable in this
cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder 
then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
the back of the settle opposite me looking on there was an expression
of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he
watched the group of faces 
 well said the stranger to mr wopsle when the reading was done you
have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt 
everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer he looked
at everybody coldly and sarcastically 
 guilty of course said he out with it come 
 sir returned mr wopsle without having the honor of your
acquaintance i do say guilty upon this we all took courage to unite
in a confirmatory murmur 
 i know you do said the stranger i knew you would i told you so 
but now i ll ask you a question do you know or do you not know 
that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is
proved proved to be guilty 
 sir mr wopsle began to reply as an englishman myself i 
 come said the stranger biting his forefinger at him don t evade
the question either you know it or you don t know it which is it to
be 
he stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a
bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at mr 
wopsle as it were to mark him out before biting it again 
 now said he do you know it or don t you know it 
 certainly i know it replied mr wopsle 
 certainly you know it then why didn t you say so at first now i ll
ask you another question taking possession of mr wopsle as if he
had a right to him do you know that none of these witnesses have yet
been cross examined 
mr wopsle was beginning i can only say when the stranger stopped
him 
 what you won t answer the question yes or no now i ll try you
again throwing his finger at him again attend to me are you
aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been
cross examined come i only want one word from you yes or no 
mr wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion
of him 
 come said the stranger i ll help you you don t deserve help but
i ll help you look at that paper you hold in your hand what is it 
 what is it repeated mr wopsle eyeing it much at a loss 
 is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious
manner the printed paper you have just been reading from 
 undoubtedly 
 undoubtedly now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly
states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers
instructed him altogether to reserve his defence 
 i read that just now mr wopsle pleaded 
 never mind what you read just now sir i don t ask you what you read
just now you may read the lord s prayer backwards if you like and 
perhaps have done it before to day turn to the paper no no no my
friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to
the bottom to the bottom we all began to think mr wopsle full of
subterfuge well have you found it 
 here it is said mr wopsle 
 now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was
instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence come do
you make that of it 
mr wopsle answered those are not the exact words 
 not the exact words repeated the gentleman bitterly is that the
exact substance 
 yes said mr wopsle 
 yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company
with his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle and now i ask
you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage
before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having
pronounced a fellow creature guilty unheard 
we all began to suspect that mr wopsle was not the man we had thought
him and that he was beginning to be found out 
 and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his
finger at mr wopsle heavily that same man might be summoned as a
juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself 
might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his
pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the
issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the
bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help
him god 
we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too
far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet
time 
the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and
with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of
us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose
it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two
settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand
in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right 
 from information i have received said he looking round at us as we
all quailed before him i have reason to believe there is a blacksmith
among you by name joseph or joe gargery which is the man 
 here is the man said joe 
the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went 
 you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as pip 
is he here 
 i am here i cried 
the stranger did not recognize me but i recognized him as the gentleman
i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss
havisham i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the settle 
and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder 
i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his
deep set eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watch chain his
strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented
soap on his great hand 
 i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had
surveyed me at his leisure it will take a little time perhaps we
had better go to your place of residence i prefer not to anticipate my
communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you
please to your friends afterwards i have nothing to do with that 
amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen 
and in a wondering silence walked home while going along the strange
gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of
his finger as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as
an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door 
our conference was held in the state parlor which was feebly lighted by
one candle 
it began with the strange gentleman s sitting down at the table drawing
the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocket book 
he then put up the pocket book and set the candle a little aside after
peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to ascertain which was
which 
 my name he said is jaggers and i am a lawyer in london i am
pretty well known i have unusual business to transact with you and i
commence by explaining that it is not of my originating if my advice
had been asked i should not have been here it was not asked and you
see me here what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i
do no less no more 
finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got
up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus
having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground 
 now joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
this young fellow your apprentice you would not object to cancel his
indentures at his request and for his good you would want nothing for
so doing 
 lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pip s way 
said joe staring 
 lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned mr 
jaggers the question is would you want anything do you want
anything 
 the answer is returned joe sternly no 
i thought mr jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool for
his disinterestedness but i was too much bewildered between breathless
curiosity and surprise to be sure of it 
 very well said mr jaggers recollect the admission you have made 
and don t try to go from it presently 
 who s a going to try retorted joe 
 i don t say anybody is do you keep a dog 
 yes i do keep a dog 
 bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better 
bear that in mind will you repeated mr jaggers shutting his eyes
and nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something 
 now i return to this young fellow and the communication i have got to
make is that he has great expectations 
joe and i gasped and looked at one another 
 i am instructed to communicate to him said mr jaggers throwing
his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property 
further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that
property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life
and from this place and be brought up as a gentleman in a word as a
young fellow of great expectations 
my dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality miss
havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale 
 now mr pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have
to say to you you are to understand first that it is the request
of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear
the name of pip you will have no objection i dare say to your great
expectations being encumbered with that easy condition but if you have
any objection this is the time to mention it 
my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears 
that i could scarcely stammer i had no objection 
 i should think not now you are to understand secondly mr pip that
the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
secret until the person chooses to reveal it i am empowered to mention
that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by
word of mouth to yourself when or where that intention may be carried
out i cannot say no one can say it may be years hence now you are
distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from
making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however
distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the
communications you may have with me if you have a suspicion in your own
breast keep that suspicion in your own breast it is not the least to
the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are they may be the
strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim this is not for
you to inquire into the condition is laid down your acceptance of it 
and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition
that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions 
and for whom i am not otherwise responsible that person is the person
from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by
that person and by me again not a very difficult condition with which
to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it 
this is the time to mention it speak out 
once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection 
 i should think not now mr pip i have done with stipulations 
though he called me mr pip and began rather to make up to me he still
could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now
he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he
spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement if he only chose to mention them we come next to mere
details of arrangement you must know that although i have used
the term expectations more than once you are not endowed with
expectations only there is already lodged in my hands a sum of money
amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance you will
please consider me your guardian oh for i was going to thank him i
tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldn t render them 
it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with
your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and
necessity of at once entering on that advantage 
i said i had always longed for it 
 never mind what you have always longed for mr pip he retorted 
 keep to the record if you long for it now that s enough am i
answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper
tutor is that it 
i stammered yes that was it 
 good now your inclinations are to be consulted i don t think that
wise mind but it s my trust have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
would prefer to another 
i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and mr wopsle s great aunt 
so i replied in the negative 
 there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think
might suit the purpose said mr jaggers i don t recommend him 
observe because i never recommend anybody the gentleman i speak of is
one mr matthew pocket 
ah i caught at the name directly miss havisham s relation the matthew
whom mr and mrs camilla had spoken of the matthew whose place was to
be at miss havisham s head when she lay dead in her bride s dress on
the bride s table 
 you know the name said mr jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then
shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer 
my answer was that i had heard of the name 
 oh said he you have heard of the name but the question is what do
you say of it 
i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his
recommendation 
 no my young friend he interrupted shaking his great head very
slowly recollect yourself 
not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him
for his recommendation 
 no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and
smiling both at once no no no it s very well done but it won t
do you are too young to fix me with it recommendation is not the word 
mr pip try another 
correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention
of mr matthew pocket 
 that s more like it cried mr jaggers and i added i would
gladly try that gentleman 
 good you had better try him in his own house the way shall be
prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london when
will you come to london 
i said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionless that i
supposed i could come directly 
 first said mr jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in 
and they should not be working clothes say this day week you ll want
some money shall i leave you twenty guineas 
he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them
out on the table and pushed them over to me this was the first time he
had taken his leg from the chair he sat astride of the chair when he
had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe 
 well joseph gargery you look dumbfoundered 
 i am said joe in a very decided manner 
 it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember 
 it were understood said joe and it are understood and it ever will
be similar according 
 but what said mr jaggers swinging his purse what if it was in my
instructions to make you a present as compensation 
 as compensation what for joe demanded 
 for the loss of his services 
joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman i have
often thought him since like the steam hammer that can crush a man or
pat an egg shell in his combination of strength with gentleness pip
is that hearty welcome said joe to go free with his services to
honor and fortun as no words can tell him but if you think as money
can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child what come
to the forge and ever the best of friends 
o dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i
see you again with your muscular blacksmith s arm before your eyes 
and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away o dear good
faithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm 
as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel s wing 
but i encouraged joe at the time i was lost in the mazes of my future
fortunes and could not retrace the by paths we had trodden together i
begged joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best
of friends and as i said we ever would be so joe scooped his eyes
with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but
said not another word 
mr jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognized in joe the
village idiot and in me his keeper when it was over he said weighing
in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing 
 now joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance no half
measures with me if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge
to make you speak out and you shall have it if on the contrary you
mean to say here to his great amazement he was stopped by joe s
suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
purpose 
 which i meantersay cried joe that if you come into my place
bull baiting and badgering me come out which i meantersay as sech if
you re a man come on which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay
and stand or fall by 
i drew joe away and he immediately became placable merely stating to
me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any
one whom it might happen to concern that he were not a going to be
bull baited and badgered in his own place mr jaggers had risen when
joe demonstrated and had backed near the door without evincing
any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory
remarks they were these 
 well mr pip i think the sooner you leave here as you are to be a
gentleman the better let it stand for this day week and you shall
receive my printed address in the meantime you can take a hackney coach
at the stage coach office in london and come straight to me 
understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust
i undertake i am paid for undertaking it and i do so now understand
that finally understand that 
he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone
on but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off 
something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was
going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired carriage 
 i beg your pardon mr jaggers 
 halloa said he facing round what s the matter 
 i wish to be quite right mr jaggers and to keep to your directions 
so i thought i had better ask would there be any objection to my taking
leave of any one i know about here before i go away 
 no said he looking as if he hardly understood me 
 i don t mean in the village only but up town 
 no said he no objection 
i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had already
locked the front door and vacated the state parlor and was seated
by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the
burning coals i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals 
and nothing was said for a long time 
my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her
needle work before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next joe
in the corner opposite my sister the more i looked into the glowing
coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe the longer the
silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak 
at length i got out joe have you told biddy 
 no pip returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his
knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make
off somewhere which i left it to yourself pip 
 i would rather you told joe 
 pip s a gentleman of fortun then said joe and god bless him in
it 
biddy dropped her work and looked at me joe held his knees and looked
at me i looked at both of them after a pause they both heartily
congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
congratulations that i rather resented 
i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy joe with the
grave obligation i considered my friends under to know nothing and say
nothing about the maker of my fortune it would all come out in good
time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save
that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron biddy
nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again 
and said she would be very particular and joe still detaining his
knees said ay ay i ll be ekervally partickler pip and then they
congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the
notion of my being a gentleman that i didn t half like it 
infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea
of what had happened to the best of my belief those efforts entirely
failed she laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even
repeated after biddy the words pip and property but i doubt if
they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest
a darker picture of her state of mind 
i never could have believed it without experience but as joe and
biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy 
dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be but it is
possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied
with myself 
any how i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand 
looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and
about what they should do without me and all that and whenever i
caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they
often looked at me particularly biddy i felt offended as if they
were expressing some mistrust of me though heaven knows they never did
by word or sign 
at those times i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen
door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to
air the room the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am afraid
i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic
objects among which i had passed my life 
 saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese
and beer five more days and then the day before the day they ll soon
go 
 yes pip observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beer mug 
 they ll soon go 
 soon soon go said biddy 
 i have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and
order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that i ll come and put
them on there or that i ll have them sent to mr pumblechook s it
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here 
 mr and mrs hubble might like to see you in your new gen teel figure
too pip said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on
it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper
as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices so might
wopsle and the jolly bargemen might take it as a compliment 
 that s just what i don t want joe they would make such a business of
it such a coarse and common business that i couldn t bear myself 
 ah that indeed pip said joe if you couldn t abear yourself 
biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sister s plate have you
thought about when you ll show yourself to mr gargery and your sister
and me you will show yourself to us won t you 
 biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick
that it s difficult to keep up with you 
 she always were quick observed joe 
 if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say
that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening most likely
on the evening before i go away 
biddy said no more handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an
affectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed when i got
into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean
little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for
ever it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at
the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind
between it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in
so often between the forge and miss havisham s and biddy and estella 
the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and
the room was warm as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw
joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two
in the air and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light
it for him he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he
wanted comforting for some reason or other 
he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe 
and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they
talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
of them more than once i would not have listened for more if i could
have heard more so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one
chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever
known 
looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joe s pipe
floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joe not
obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared
together i put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy
bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more 
morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life 
and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same what lay
heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened
between me and the day of departure for i could not divest myself of
a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and
that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean
gone 
joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our
approaching separation but they only referred to it when i did after
breakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
parlor and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free with
all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe and
thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn t have read that about the rich man
and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all 
after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off
the marshes at once and get them done with as i passed the church i
felt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion
for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after
sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the
low green mounds i promised myself that i would do something for them
one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a
dinner of roast beef and plum pudding a pint of ale and a gallon of
condescension upon everybody in the village 
if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my
companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those
graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place recalled
the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge my
comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless
been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might
be veritably dead into the bargain 
no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these
grazing cattle though they seemed in their dull manner to wear a
more respectful air now and to face round in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectations farewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood 
henceforth i was for london and greatness not for smith s work in
general and for you i made my exultant way to the old battery and 
lying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham intended
me for estella fell asleep 
when i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me 
smoking his pipe he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
eyes and said 
 as being the last time pip i thought i d foller 
 and joe i am very glad you did so 
 thankee pip 
 you may be sure dear joe i went on after we had shaken hands that
i shall never forget you 
 no no pip said joe in a comfortable tone i m sure of that ay 
ay old chap bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in
a man s mind to be certain on it but it took a bit of time to get it
well round the change come so oncommon plump didn t it 
somehow i was not best pleased with joe s being so mightily secure of
me i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said 
 it does you credit pip or something of that sort therefore i made
no remark on joe s first head merely saying as to his second that the
tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a
gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i
were one 
 have you though said joe astonishing 
 it s a pity now joe said i that you did not get on a little more 
when we had our lessons here isn t it 
 well i don t know returned joe i m so awful dull i m only master
of my own trade it were always a pity as i was so awful dull but it s
no more of a pity now than it was this day twelvemonth don t you
see 
what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to
do something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he
had been better qualified for a rise in station he was so perfectly
innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to
biddy in preference 
so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our
little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget
her said i had a favor to ask of her 
 and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of
helping joe on a little 
 how helping him on asked biddy with a steady sort of glance 
 well joe is a dear good fellow in fact i think he is the dearest
fellow that ever lived but he is rather backward in some things for
instance biddy in his learning and his manners 
although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her
eyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me 
 o his manners won t his manners do then asked biddy plucking a
black currant leaf 
 my dear biddy they do very well here 
 o they do very well here interrupted biddy looking closely at the
leaf in her hand 
 hear me out but if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i
shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would
hardly do him justice 
 and don t you think he knows that asked biddy 
it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me that i said snappishly 
 biddy what do you mean 
biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands and the
smell of a black currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
in the little garden by the side of the lane said have you never
considered that he may be proud 
 proud i repeated with disdainful emphasis 
 o there are many kinds of pride said biddy looking full at me and
shaking her head pride is not all of one kind 
 well what are you stopping for said i 
 not all of one kind resumed biddy he may be too proud to let any
one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well
and with respect to tell you the truth i think he is though it sounds
bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do 
 now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you i did not
expect to see this in you you are envious biddy and grudging you
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you can t help
showing it 
 if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so say so
over and over again if you have the heart to think so 
 if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous
and superior tone don t put it off upon me i am very sorry to see it 
and it s a it s a bad side of human nature i did intend to ask you
to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of
improving dear joe but after this i ask you nothing i am extremely
sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated it s a it s a bad side
of human nature 
 whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may
equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here 
at all times and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make
no difference in my remembrance of you yet a gentleman should not be
unjust neither said biddy turning away her head 
i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which
sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i
was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy and
biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a
dejected stroll until supper time again feeling it very sorrowful and
strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as
lonely and unsatisfactory as the first 
but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to
biddy and we dropped the subject putting on the best clothes i had 
i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open 
and presented myself before mr trabb the tailor who was having his
breakfast in the parlor behind his shop and who did not think it worth
his while to come out to me but called me in to him 
 well said mr trabb in a hail fellow well met kind of way how are
you and what can i do for you 
mr trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather beds and was
slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up he was a
prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous
little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of
his prosperity were put away in it in bags 
 mr trabb said i it s an unpleasant thing to have to mention 
because it looks like boasting but i have come into a handsome
property 
a change passed over mr trabb he forgot the butter in bed got up from
the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming lord
bless my soul 
 i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some
guineas out of my pocket and looking at them and i want a fashionable
suit of clothes to go in i wish to pay for them i added otherwise i
thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money 
 my dear sir said mr trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened
his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
elbow don t hurt me by mentioning that may i venture to congratulate
you would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop 
mr trabb s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country side 
when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his
labors by sweeping over me he was still sweeping when i came out into
the shop with mr trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible
corners and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with any
blacksmith alive or dead 
 hold that noise said mr trabb with the greatest sternness or i ll
knock your head off do me the favor to be seated sir now this 
said mr trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a
flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under
it to show the gloss is a very sweet article i can recommend it for
your purpose sir because it really is extra super but you shall
see some others give me number four you to the boy and with a
dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreant s
brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity 
mr trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again 
then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight and let
me have none of your tricks here said mr trabb or you shall repent
it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live 
mr trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an
article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that
it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished
fellow townsman s if he might claim me for a fellow townsman having
worn are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said mr 
trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and
bring them myself 
i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of mr trabb s
judgment and re entered the parlor to be measured for although mr 
trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented
with it he said apologetically that it wouldn t do under existing
circumstances sir wouldn t do at all so mr trabb measured and
calculated me in the parlor as if i were an estate and he the finest
species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that
i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his
pains when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
to mr pumblechook s on the thursday evening he said with his hand
upon the parlor lock i know sir that london gentlemen cannot be
expected to patronize local work as a rule but if you would give me a
turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem
it good morning sir much obliged door 
the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what
it meant but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his
hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
was that it had morally laid upon his back trabb s boy 
after this memorable event i went to the hatter s and the bootmaker s 
and the hosier s and felt rather like mother hubbard s dog whose outfit
required the services of so many trades i also went to the coach office
and took my place for seven o clock on saturday morning it was
not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome
property but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that
the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through
the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me when
i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards
pumblechook s and as i approached that gentleman s place of business 
i saw him standing at his door 
he was waiting for me with great impatience he had been out early with
the chaise cart and had called at the forge and heard the news he had
prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlor and he too ordered
his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed 
 my dear friend said mr pumblechook taking me by both hands when
he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good
fortune well deserved well deserved 
this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself 
 to think said mr pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for
some moments that i should have been the humble instrument of leading
up to this is a proud reward 
i begged mr pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
hinted on that point 
 my dear young friend said mr pumblechook if you will allow me to
call you so 
i murmured certainly and mr pumblechook took me by both hands again 
and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional
appearance though it was rather low down my dear young friend rely
upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before
the mind of joseph joseph said mr pumblechook in the way of a
compassionate adjuration joseph joseph thereupon he shook his
head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph 
 but my dear young friend said mr pumblechook you must be hungry 
you must be exhausted be seated here is a chicken had round from the
boar here is a tongue had round from the boar here s one or two little
things had round from the boar that i hope you may not despise but do
i said mr pumblechook getting up again the moment after he had sat
down see afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of happy
infancy and may i may i 
this may i meant might he shake hands i consented and he was fervent 
and then sat down again 
 here is wine said mr pumblechook let us drink thanks to fortune 
and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment and yet i
cannot said mr pumblechook getting up again see afore me one and
likewise drink to one without again expressing may i may i 
i said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his glass
and turned it upside down i did the same and if i had turned myself
upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to
my head 
mr pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of
tongue none of those out of the way no thoroughfares of pork now and
took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all ah poultry 
poultry you little thought said mr pumblechook apostrophizing the
fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for
you you little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble
roof for one as call it a weakness if you will said mr pumblechook 
getting up again but may i may i 
it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so
he did it at once how he ever did it so often without wounding himself
with my knife i don t know 
 and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had
the honor of bringing you up by hand it s a sad picter to reflect that
she s no longer equal to fully understanding the honor may 
i saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him 
 we ll drink her health said i 
 ah cried mr pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid
with admiration that s the way you know em sir i don t know
who sir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person
present that s the way you know the noble minded sir ever forgiving
and ever affable it might said the servile pumblechook putting down
his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person 
have the appearance of repeating but may i 
when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister let us
never be blind said mr pumblechook to her faults of temper but it
is to be hoped she meant well 
at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in
the face as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting 
i mentioned to mr pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes
sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him i
mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village 
and he lauded it to the skies there was nobody but himself he
intimated worthy of my confidence and in short might he then he
asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we
had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he
had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend if i had taken
ten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he
never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of
hearts have repudiated the idea yet for all that i remember feeling
convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a
sensible practical good hearted prime fellow 
by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my
advice in reference to his own affairs he mentioned that there was an
opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred
before in that or any other neighborhood what alone was wanting to the
realization of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital 
those were the two little words more capital now it appeared to him
 pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a
sleeping partner sir which sleeping partner would have nothing to
do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine
the books and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his
pocket to the tune of fifty per cent it appeared to him that that
might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
property which would be worthy of his attention but what did i think 
he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think i gave it
as my opinion wait a bit the united vastness and distinctness of
this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands
with me but said he really must and did 
we drank all the wine and mr pumblechook pledged himself over and over
again to keep joseph up to the mark i don t know what mark and to
render me efficient and constant service i don t know what service he
also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after
having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me 
 that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common
fortun he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
think of now and i said so too finally i went out into the air with
a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without
having taken any account of the road 
there i was roused by mr pumblechook s hailing me he was a long way
down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to
stop i stopped and he came up breathless 
 no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech 
 not if i can help it this occasion shall not entirely pass without
that affability on your part may i as an old friend and well wisher 
may i 
we shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young
carter out of my way with the greatest indignation then he blessed
me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the
road and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
before i pursued my way home 
i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little
i possessed was adapted to my new station but i began packing that same
afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want next
morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost 
so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed and on friday morning i
went to mr pumblechook s to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
miss havisham mr pumblechook s own room was given up to me to dress
in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event my
clothes were rather a disappointment of course probably every new
and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell
a trifle short of the wearer s expectation but after i had had my
new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of
posturing with mr pumblechook s very limited dressing glass in the
futile endeavor to see my legs it seemed to fit me better it being
market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off mr pumblechook
was not at home i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and
was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing this was
all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed
of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a
personal disadvantage something like joe s in his sunday suit 
i went circuitously to miss havisham s by all the back ways and rang
at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my
gloves sarah pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when
she saw me so changed her walnut shell countenance likewise turned from
brown to green and yellow 
 you said she you good gracious what do you want 
 i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say good by to
miss havisham 
i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went
to ask if i were to be admitted after a very short delay she returned
and took me up staring at me all the way 
miss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
table leaning on her crutch stick the room was lighted as of yore and
at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned she was then just
abreast of the rotted bride cake 
 don t go sarah she said well pip 
 i start for london miss havisham to morrow i was exceedingly
careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking
leave of you 
 this is a gay figure pip said she making her crutch stick play
round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were
bestowing the finishing gift 
 i have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss
havisham i murmured and i am so grateful for it miss havisham 
 ay ay said she looking at the discomfited and envious sarah with
delight i have seen mr jaggers i have heard about it pip so you go
to morrow 
 yes miss havisham 
 and you are adopted by a rich person 
 yes miss havisham 
 not named 
 no miss havisham 
 and mr jaggers is made your guardian 
 yes miss havisham 
she quite gloated on these questions and answers so keen was her
enjoyment of sarah pocket s jealous dismay well she went on you
have a promising career before you be good deserve it and abide by
mr jaggers s instructions she looked at me and looked at sarah and
sarah s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile good
by pip you will always keep the name of pip you know 
 yes miss havisham 
 good by pip 
she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to
my lips i had not considered how i should take leave of her it came
naturally to me at the moment to do this she looked at sarah pocket
with triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with
both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly
lighted room beside the rotten bride cake that was hidden in cobwebs 
sarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen
out she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree
confounded i said good by miss pocket but she merely stared and
did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken clear of the
house i made the best of my way back to pumblechook s took off my new
clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress 
carrying it to speak the truth much more at my ease too though i had
the bundle to carry 
and now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had
run out fast and were gone and to morrow looked me in the face more
steadily than i could look at it as the six evenings had dwindled
away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more
appreciative of the society of joe and biddy on this last evening i
dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my
splendor until bedtime we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by
the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with we were
all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits 
i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little
hand portmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all
alone i am afraid sore afraid that this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to
the coach together i had pretended with myself that there was nothing
of this taint in the arrangement but when i went up to my little room
on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and
had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me
in the morning i did not 
all night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places
instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now
pigs now men never horses fantastic failures of journeys occupied
me until the day dawned and the birds were singing then i got up and
partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in
taking it fell asleep 
biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not
sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon 
but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the
teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go down stairs 
after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping
my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy
called to me that i was late 
it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it i got up from the meal 
saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me 
 well i suppose i must be off and then i kissed my sister who was
laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed
biddy and threw my arms around joe s neck then i took up my little
portmanteau and walked out the last i saw of them was when i presently
heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing an old
shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe i stopped then to
wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above his head 
crying huskily hooroar and biddy put her apron to her face 
i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had
supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to
have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high
street i whistled and made nothing of going but the village was very
peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to
show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all
beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave
and sob i broke into tears it was by the finger post at the end of the
village and i laid my hand upon it and said good by o my dear dear
friend 
heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain
upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts i was
better after i had cried than before more sorry more aware of my own
ingratitude more gentle if i had cried before i should have had joe
with me then 
so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the
course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear
of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get
down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at
home and a better parting we changed and i had not made up my mind 
and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to
get down and walk back when we changed again and while i was occupied
with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to joe
in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat
high as if he could possibly be there 
we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to
go back and i went on and the mists had all solemnly risen now and
the world lay spread before me 
this is the end of the first stage of pip s expectations 
the journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
hours it was a little past midday when the four horse stage coach by
which i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
the cross keys wood street cheapside london 
we britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything otherwise 
while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i might have had
some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and
dirty 
mr jaggers had duly sent me his address it was little britain and he
had written after it on his card just out of smithfield and close by
the coach office nevertheless a hackney coachman who seemed to have
as many capes to his greasy great coat as he was years old packed me
up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of
steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles his getting on his
box which i remember to have been decorated with an old weather stained
pea green hammercloth moth eaten into rags was quite a work of time 
it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged
things behind for i don t know how many footmen to hold on by and
a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the
temptation 
i had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
straw yard it was and yet how like a rag shop and to wonder why
the horses nose bags were kept inside when i observed the coachman
beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently and stop
we presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open
door whereon was painted mr jaggers 
 how much i asked the coachman 
the coachman answered a shilling unless you wish to make it more 
i naturally said i had no wish to make it more 
 then it must be a shilling observed the coachman i don t want to
get into trouble i know him he darkly closed an eye at mr jaggers s
name and shook his head 
when he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the
ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his
mind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked was mr jaggers at home 
 he is not returned the clerk he is in court at present am i
addressing mr pip 
i signified that he was addressing mr pip 
 mr jaggers left word would you wait in his room he couldn t say how
long he might be having a case on but it stands to reason his time
being valuable that he won t be longer than he can help 
with those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner
chamber at the back here we found a gentleman with one eye in a
velveteen suit and knee breeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper 
 go and wait outside mike said the clerk 
i began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk
shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used 
and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone 
mr jaggers s room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal
place the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the
distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
peep down at me through it there were not so many papers about as i
should have expected to see and there were some odd objects about that
i should not have expected to see such as an old rusty pistol a
sword in a scabbard several strange looking boxes and packages and
two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly swollen and twitchy
about the nose mr jaggers s own high backed chair was of deadly black
horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin and i
fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at
the clients the room was but small and the clients seemed to have had
a habit of backing up against the wall the wall especially opposite to
mr jaggers s chair being greasy with shoulders i recalled too that
the one eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when i was
the innocent cause of his being turned out 
i sat down in the cliental chair placed over against mr jaggers s
chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place i
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
everybody else s disadvantage as his master had i wondered how many
other clerks there were up stairs and whether they all claimed to have
the same detrimental mastery of their fellow creatures i wondered what
was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came
there i wondered whether the two swollen faces were of mr jaggers s
family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
ill looking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the
blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home 
of course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits may
have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit
that lay thick on everything but i sat wondering and waiting in mr 
jaggers s close room until i really could not bear the two casts on the
shelf above mr jaggers s chair and got up and went out 
when i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i
waited he advised me to go round the corner and i should come into
smithfield so i came into smithfield and the shameful place being all
asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me so 
i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where
i saw the great black dome of saint paul s bulging at me from behind a
grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate prison following
the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered with straw to deaden
the noise of passing vehicles and from this and from the quantity of
people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer i inferred
that the trials were on 
while i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
minister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a
trial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half a
crown whence i should command a full view of the lord chief justice in
his wig and robes mentioning that awful personage like waxwork and
presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen pence as i
declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as
to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also
where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtors 
door out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on em 
would come out at that door the day after to morrow at eight in the
morning to be killed in a row this was horrible and gave me a
sickening idea of london the more so as the lord chief justice s
proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his
pocket handkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently
not belonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had
bought cheap of the executioner under these circumstances i thought
myself well rid of him for a shilling 
i dropped into the office to ask if mr jaggers had come in yet and i
found he had not and i strolled out again this time i made the tour
of little britain and turned into bartholomew close and now i became
aware that other people were waiting about for mr jaggers as well
as i there were two men of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew
close and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when
they first passed me that jaggers would do it if it was to be done 
there was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and
one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted
her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders jaggers
is for him melia and what more could you have there was a red eyed
little jew who came into the close while i was loitering there in
company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand and
while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a highly
excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp post and
accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the words o jaggerth 
jaggerth jaggerth all otherth ith cag maggerth give me jaggerth 
these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep
impression on me and i admired and wondered more than ever 
at length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close
into little britain i saw mr jaggers coming across the road towards
me all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there
was quite a rush at him mr jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder
and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed
himself to his followers 
first he took the two secret men 
 now i have nothing to say to you said mr jaggers throwing his
finger at them i want to know no more than i know as to the result 
it s a toss up i told you from the first it was a toss up have you
paid wemmick 
 we made the money up this morning sir said one of the men 
submissively while the other perused mr jaggers s face 
 i don t ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it
up at all has wemmick got it 
 yes sir said both the men together 
 very well then you may go now i won t have it said mr jaggers 
waving his hand at them to put them behind him if you say a word to
me i ll throw up the case 
 we thought mr jaggers one of the men began pulling off his hat 
 that s what i told you not to do said mr jaggers you thought i
think for you that s enough for you if i want you i know where to
find you i don t want you to find me now i won t have it i won t hear
a word 
the two men looked at one another as mr jaggers waved them behind
again and humbly fell back and were heard no more 
 and now you said mr jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on
the two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly
separated oh amelia is it 
 yes mr jaggers 
 and do you remember retorted mr jaggers that but for me you
wouldn t be here and couldn t be here 
 o yes sir exclaimed both women together lord bless you sir well
we knows that 
 then why said mr jaggers do you come here 
 my bill sir the crying woman pleaded 
 now i tell you what said mr jaggers once for all if you don t
know that your bill s in good hands i know it and if you come here
bothering about your bill i ll make an example of both your bill and
you and let him slip through my fingers have you paid wemmick 
 o yes sir every farden 
 very well then you have done all you have got to do say another
word one single word and wemmick shall give you your money back 
this terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately 
no one remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the
skirts of mr jaggers s coat to his lips several times 
 i don t know this man said mr jaggers in the same devastating
strain what does this fellow want 
 ma thear mithter jaggerth hown brother to habraham latharuth 
 who s he said mr jaggers let go of my coat 
the suitor kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing
it replied habraham latharuth on thuthpithion of plate 
 you re too late said mr jaggers i am over the way 
 holy father mithter jaggerth cried my excitable acquaintance 
turning white don t thay you re again habraham latharuth 
 i am said mr jaggers and there s an end of it get out of the
way 
 mithter jaggerth half a moment my hown cuthen th gone to mithter
wemmick at thith prethent minute to hoffer him hany termth mithter
jaggerth half a quarter of a moment if you d have the condethenthun to
be bought off from the t other thide at hany thuperior prithe money
no object mithter jaggerth mithter 
my guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference and
left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot without further
interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and
the man in velveteen with the fur cap 
 here s mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and
approaching mr jaggers confidentially 
 oh said mr jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of
hair in the middle of his forehead like the bull in cock robin pulling
at the bell rope your man comes on this afternoon well 
 well mas r jaggers returned mike in the voice of a sufferer from a
constitutional cold arter a deal o trouble i ve found one sir as
might do 
 what is he prepared to swear 
 well mas r jaggers said mike wiping his nose on his fur cap this
time in a general way anythink 
mr jaggers suddenly became most irate now i warned you before said
he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client that if you ever
presumed to talk in that way here i d make an example of you you
infernal scoundrel how dare you tell me that 
the client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious
what he had done 
 spooney said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his
elbow soft head need you say it face to face 
 now i ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly 
 once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is
prepared to swear 
mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson
from his face and slowly replied ayther to character or to having
been in his company and never left him all the night in question 
 now be careful in what station of life is this man 
mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the
ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before
beginning to reply in a nervous manner we ve dressed him up like 
when my guardian blustered out 
 what you will will you 
 spooney added the clerk again with another stir 
after some helpless casting about mike brightened and began again 
 he is dressed like a spectable pieman a sort of a pastry cook 
 is he here asked my guardian 
 i left him said mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner 
 take him past that window and let me see him 
the window indicated was the office window we all three went to
it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner with a murderous looking tall individual in a short
suit of white linen and a paper cap this guileless confectioner was not
by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery 
which was painted over 
 tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the
clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a
fellow as that 
my guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched 
standing from a sandwich box and a pocket flask of sherry he seemed to
bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he
had made for me i was to go to barnard s inn to young mr pocket s
rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation i was to
remain with young mr pocket until monday on monday i was to go with
him to his father s house on a visit that i might try how i liked it 
also i was told what my allowance was to be it was a very liberal
one and had handed to me from one of my guardian s drawers the cards
of certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kinds of clothes 
and such other things as i could in reason want you will find your
credit good mr pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt
like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but i shall by
this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find you
outrunning the constable of course you ll go wrong somehow but that s
no fault of mine 
after i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked
mr jaggers if i could send for a coach he said it was not worth while 
i was so near my destination wemmick should walk round with me if i
pleased 
i then found that wemmick was the clerk in the next room another clerk
was rung down from up stairs to take his place while he was out and i
accompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian 
we found a new set of people lingering outside but wemmick made a way
among them by saying coolly yet decisively i tell you it s no use he
won t have a word to say to one of you and we soon got clear of them 
and went on side by side 
casting my eyes on mr wemmick as we went along to see what he was
like in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in
stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been
imperfectly chipped out with a dull edged chisel there were some marks
in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and
the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints the chisel
had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose 
but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off i judged him
to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements for he wore at least four
mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping
willow at a tomb with an urn on it i noticed too that several rings
and seals hung at his watch chain as if he were quite laden with
remembrances of departed friends he had glittering eyes small keen 
and black and thin wide mottled lips he had had them to the best of
my belief from forty to fifty years 
 so you were never in london before said mr wemmick to me 
 no said i 
 i was new here once said mr wemmick rum to think of now 
 you are well acquainted with it now 
 why yes said mr wemmick i know the moves of it 
 is it a very wicked place i asked more for the sake of saying
something than for information 
 you may get cheated robbed and murdered in london but there are
plenty of people anywhere who ll do that for you 
 if there is bad blood between you and them said i to soften it off a
little 
 o i don t know about bad blood returned mr wemmick there s not
much bad blood about they ll do it if there s anything to be got by
it 
 that makes it worse 
 you think so returned mr wemmick much about the same i should
say 
he wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him 
walking in a self contained way as if there were nothing in the streets
to claim his attention his mouth was such a post office of a mouth
that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling we had got to the top of
holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance 
and that he was not smiling at all 
 do you know where mr matthew pocket lives i asked mr wemmick 
 yes said he nodding in the direction at hammersmith west of
london 
 is that far 
 well say five miles 
 do you know him 
 why you re a regular cross examiner said mr wemmick looking at me
with an approving air yes i know him i know him 
there was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
these words that rather depressed me and i was still looking sideways
at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text 
when he said here we were at barnard s inn my depression was not
alleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment
to be an hotel kept by mr barnard to which the blue boar in our town
was a mere public house whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied
spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
tom cats 
we entered this haven through a wicket gate and were disgorged by an
introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
like a flat burying ground i thought it had the most dismal trees in
it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most
dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that i had ever seen i
thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled
flower pot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift while
to let to let to let glared at me from empty rooms as if no new
wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of barnard were
being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants
and their unholy interment under the gravel a frowzy mourning of soot
and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard and it had strewn
ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere
dust hole thus far my sense of sight while dry rot and wet rot and all
the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar rot of rat
and mouse and bug and coaching stables near at hand besides addressed
themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned try barnard s
mixture 
so imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations 
that i looked in dismay at mr wemmick ah said he mistaking me 
 the retirement reminds you of the country so it does me 
he led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs which
appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of
those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
themselves without the means of coming down to a set of chambers on
the top floor mr pocket jun was painted on the door and there was
a label on the letter box return shortly 
 he hardly thought you d come so soon mr wemmick explained you
don t want me any more 
 no thank you said i 
 as i keep the cash mr wemmick observed we shall most likely meet
pretty often good day 
 good day 
i put out my hand and mr wemmick at first looked at it as if he
thought i wanted something then he looked at me and said correcting
himself 
 to be sure yes you re in the habit of shaking hands 
i was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion 
but said yes 
 i have got so out of it said mr wemmick except at last very
glad i m sure to make your acquaintance good day 
when we had shaken hands and he was gone i opened the staircase window
and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it
came down like the guillotine happily it was so quick that i had not
put my head out after this escape i was content to take a foggy view
of the inn through the window s encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully
looking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated 
mr pocket junior s idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly
maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written
my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
window before i heard footsteps on the stairs gradually there arose
before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a
member of society of about my own standing he had a paper bag under
each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of
breath 
 mr pip said he 
 mr pocket said i 
 dear me he exclaimed i am extremely sorry but i knew there was a
coach from your part of the country at midday and i thought you would
come by that one the fact is i have been out on your account not
that that is any excuse for i thought coming from the country you
might like a little fruit after dinner and i went to covent garden
market to get it good 
for a reason that i had i felt as if my eyes would start out of my
head i acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think this
was a dream 
 dear me said mr pocket junior this door sticks so 
as he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
the paper bags were under his arms i begged him to allow me to hold
them he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with
the door as if it were a wild beast it yielded so suddenly at last 
that he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite
door and we both laughed but still i felt as if my eyes must start out
of my head and as if this must be a dream 
 pray come in said mr pocket junior allow me to lead the way i am
rather bare here but i hope you ll be able to make out tolerably well
till monday my father thought you would get on more agreeably through
to morrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk about
london i am sure i shall be very happy to show london to you as to our
table you won t find that bad i hope for it will be supplied from our
coffee house here and it is only right i should add at your expense 
such being mr jaggers s directions as to our lodging it s not by
any means splendid because i have my own bread to earn and my father
hasn t anything to give me and i shouldn t be willing to take it if he
had this is our sitting room just such chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth you see as they could spare from home you mustn t give
me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come
for you from the coffee house this is my little bedroom rather musty 
but barnard s is musty this is your bedroom the furniture s hired for
the occasion but i trust it will answer the purpose if you should want
anything i ll go and fetch it the chambers are retired and we shall
be alone together but we shan t fight i dare say but dear me i beg
your pardon you re holding the fruit all this time pray let me take
these bags from you i am quite ashamed 
as i stood opposite to mr pocket junior delivering him the bags one 
two i saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that i knew to
be in mine and he said falling back 
 lord bless me you re the prowling boy 
 and you said i are the pale young gentleman 
the pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in
barnard s inn until we both burst out laughing the idea of its
being you said he the idea of its being you said i and then we
contemplated one another afresh and laughed again well said the
pale young gentleman reaching out his hand good humoredly it s all
over now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if you ll forgive me
for having knocked you about so 
i derived from this speech that mr herbert pocket for herbert was the
pale young gentleman s name still rather confounded his intention with
his execution but i made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly 
 you hadn t come into your good fortune at that time said herbert
pocket 
 no said i 
 no he acquiesced i heard it had happened very lately i was rather
on the lookout for good fortune then 
 indeed 
 yes miss havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to
me but she couldn t at all events she didn t 
i thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that 
 bad taste said herbert laughing but a fact yes she had sent for
me on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i
suppose i should have been provided for perhaps i should have been
what you may called it to estella 
 what s that i asked with sudden gravity 
he was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his
attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word 
 affianced he explained still busy with the fruit betrothed 
engaged what s his named any word of that sort 
 how did you bear your disappointment i asked 
 pooh said he i didn t care much for it she s a tartar 
 miss havisham 
 i don t say no to that but i meant estella that girl s hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by
miss havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex 
 what relation is she to miss havisham 
 none said he only adopted 
 why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex what revenge 
 lord mr pip said he don t you know 
 no said i 
 dear me it s quite a story and shall be saved till dinner time and
now let me take the liberty of asking you a question how did you come
there that day 
i told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst
out laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards i didn t
ask him if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly
established 
 mr jaggers is your guardian i understand he went on 
 yes 
 you know he is miss havisham s man of business and solicitor and has
her confidence when nobody else has 
this was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground i answered with
a constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen mr jaggers
in miss havisham s house on the very day of our combat but never at any
other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having ever
seen me there 
 he was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he
called on my father to propose it of course he knew about my father
from his connection with miss havisham my father is miss havisham s
cousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he
is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her 
herbert pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking 
i had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since 
who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural
incapacity to do anything secret and mean there was something
wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the
same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich i
don t know how this was i became imbued with the notion on that first
occasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what
means 
he was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor
about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem
indicative of natural strength he had not a handsome face but it was
better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful his figure
was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and
young whether mr trabb s local work would have sat more gracefully on
him than on me may be a question but i am conscious that he carried
off his rather old clothes much better than i carried off my new suit 
as he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a
bad return unsuited to our years i therefore told him my small story 
and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was 
i further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a
country place and knew very little of the ways of politeness i would
take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever
he saw me at a loss or going wrong 
 with pleasure said he though i venture to prophesy that you ll want
very few hints i dare say we shall be often together and i should like
to banish any needless restraint between us will you do me the favour
to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbert 
i thanked him and said i would i informed him in exchange that my
christian name was philip 
 i don t take to philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral
boy out of the spelling book who was so lazy that he fell into a pond 
or so fat that he couldn t see out of his eyes or so avaricious that
he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a
bird s nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
neighborhood i tell you what i should like we are so harmonious and
you have been a blacksmith would you mind it 
 i shouldn t mind anything that you propose i answered but i don t
understand you 
 would you mind handel for a familiar name there s a charming piece of
music by handel called the harmonious blacksmith 
 i should like it very much 
 then my dear handel said he turning round as the door opened 
 here is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the table 
because the dinner is of your providing 
this i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him it was a
nice little dinner seemed to me then a very lord mayor s feast and
it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
circumstances with no old people by and with london all around us 
this again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the
banquet off for while the table was as mr pumblechook might have
said the lap of luxury being entirely furnished forth from the
coffee house the circumjacent region of sitting room was of a
comparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter
the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he
fell over them the melted butter in the arm chair the bread on the
bookshelves the cheese in the coal scuttle and the boiled fowl into my
bed in the next room where i found much of its parsley and butter in
a state of congelation when i retired for the night all this made the
feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my
pleasure was without alloy 
we had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert of his
promise to tell me about miss havisham 
 true he replied i ll redeem it at once let me introduce the topic 
handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put the
knife in the mouth for fear of accidents and that while the fork is
reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary it is
scarcely worth mentioning only it s as well to do as other people do 
also the spoon is not generally used over hand but under this has
two advantages you get at your mouth better which after all is the
object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on
the part of the right elbow 
he offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both
laughed and i scarcely blushed 
 now he pursued concerning miss havisham miss havisham you must
know was a spoilt child her mother died when she was a baby and her
father denied her nothing her father was a country gentleman down in
your part of the world and was a brewer i don t know why it should
be a crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you
cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was
and brew you see it every day 
 yet a gentleman may not keep a public house may he said i 
 not on any account returned herbert but a public house may keep a
gentleman well mr havisham was very rich and very proud so was his
daughter 
 miss havisham was an only child i hazarded 
 stop a moment i am coming to that no she was not an only child 
she had a half brother her father privately married again his cook i
rather think 
 i thought he was proud said i 
 my good handel so he was he married his second wife privately 
because he was proud and in course of time she died when she was dead 
i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then
the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are
acquainted with as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous 
extravagant undutiful altogether bad at last his father disinherited
him but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though
not nearly so well off as miss havisham take another glass of wine 
and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one
to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one s glass as to turn it
bottom upwards with the rim on one s nose 
i had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital i
thanked him and apologized he said not at all and resumed 
 miss havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after
as a great match her half brother had now ample means again but what
with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again 
there were stronger differences between him and her than there had been
between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep
and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father s anger 
now i come to the cruel part of the story merely breaking off my
dear handel to remark that a dinner napkin will not go into a tumbler 
why i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to
say i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits again i thanked him and apologized and again he
said in the cheerfullest manner not at all i am sure and resumed 
 there appeared upon the scene say at the races or the public
balls or anywhere else you like a certain man who made love to miss
havisham i never saw him for this happened five and twenty years ago 
before you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that
he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose but that he was
not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my
father most strongly asseverates because it is a principle of his that
no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world
began a true gentleman in manner he says no varnish can hide the
grain of the wood and that the more varnish you put on the more the
grain will express itself well this man pursued miss havisham closely 
and professed to be devoted to her i believe she had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time but all the susceptibility she possessed
certainly came out then and she passionately loved him there is no
doubt that she perfectly idolized him he practised on her affection in
that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he
induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had
been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea
that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all your
guardian was not at that time in miss havisham s counsels and she was
too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one her relations
were poor and scheming with the exception of my father he was poor
enough but not time serving or jealous the only independent one among
them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and
was placing herself too unreservedly in his power she took the first
opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his
presence and my father has never seen her since 
i thought of her having said matthew will come and see me at last when
i am laid dead upon that table and i asked herbert whether his father
was so inveterate against her 
 it s not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her
intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would
look true even to him and even to her to return to the man and make
an end of him the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were
bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were
invited the day came but not the bridegroom he wrote her a letter 
 which she received i struck in when she was dressing for her
marriage at twenty minutes to nine 
 at the hour and minute said herbert nodding at which she
afterwards stopped all the clocks what was in it further than that
it most heartlessly broke the marriage off i can t tell you because i
don t know when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she
laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since
looked upon the light of day 
 is that all the story i asked after considering it 
 all i know of it and indeed i only know so much through piecing it
out for myself for my father always avoids it and even when miss
havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was
absolutely requisite i should understand but i have forgotten one
thing it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced
confidence acted throughout in concert with her half brother that it
was a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profits 
 i wonder he didn t marry her and get all the property said i 
 he may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have
been a part of her half brother s scheme said herbert mind i don t
know that 
 what became of the two men i asked after again considering the
subject 
 they fell into deeper shame and degradation if there can be
deeper and ruin 
 are they alive now 
 i don t know 
 you said just now that estella was not related to miss havisham but
adopted when adopted 
herbert shrugged his shoulders there has always been an estella since
i have heard of a miss havisham i know no more and now handel said
he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly
open understanding between us all that i know about miss havisham you
know 
 and all that i know i retorted you know 
 i fully believe it so there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me and as to the condition on which you hold your
advancement in life namely that you are not to inquire or discuss to
whom you owe it you may be very sure that it will never be encroached
upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me 
in truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject
done with even though i should be under his father s roof for years and
years to come yet he said it with so much meaning too that i felt
he as perfectly understood miss havisham to be my benefactress as i
understood the fact myself 
it had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for
the purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the
lighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this
to be the case we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the
course of conversation what he was he replied a capitalist an
insurer of ships i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search
of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added in the city 
i had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in
the city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer
on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible
head open but again there came upon me for my relief that odd
impression that herbert pocket would never be very successful or rich 
 i shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
ships i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut into the
direction i shall also do a little in the mining way none of these
things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
account i think i shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to
the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious
woods it s an interesting trade 
 and the profits are large said i 
 tremendous said he 
i wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than
my own 
 i think i shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his
waist coat pockets to the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum 
also to ceylon specially for elephants tusks 
 you will want a good many ships said i 
 a perfect fleet said he 
quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked him
where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present 
 i haven t begun insuring yet he replied i am looking about me 
somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnard s inn i said
 in a tone of conviction ah h 
 yes i am in a counting house and looking about me 
 is a counting house profitable i asked 
 to do you mean to the young fellow who s in it he asked in reply 
 yes to you 
 why n no not to me he said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance not directly profitable that is 
it doesn t pay me anything and i have to keep myself 
this certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as
if i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
capital from such a source of income 
 but the thing is said herbert pocket that you look about you 
that s the grand thing you are in a counting house you know and you
look about you 
it struck me as a singular implication that you couldn t be out of a
counting house you know and look about you but i silently deferred to
his experience 
 then the time comes said herbert when you see your opening and you
go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there
you are when you have once made your capital you have nothing to do
but employ it 
this was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden 
very like his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded
to his manner of bearing that defeat it seemed to me that he took all
blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine
then it was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest
necessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have been
sent in on my account from the coffee house or somewhere else 
yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so
unassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being
puffed up it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways 
and we got on famously in the evening we went out for a walk in the
streets and went half price to the theatre and next day we went to
church at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the
parks and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished joe did 
on a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had
left joe and biddy the space interposed between myself and them partook
of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off that i could
have been at our old church in my old church going clothes on the very
last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities 
geographical and social solar and lunar yet in the london streets so
crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening 
there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i had put the poor
old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of night the footsteps
of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about barnard s inn 
under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart 
on the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert went to
the counting house to report himself to look about him too i
suppose and i bore him company he was to come away in an hour or
two to attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him it
appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were
incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the
places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning nor
did the counting house where herbert assisted show in my eyes as at
all a good observatory being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy
presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second
floor rather than a look out 
i waited about until it was noon and i went upon change and i saw
fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to
be great merchants though i couldn t understand why they should all be
out of spirits when herbert came we went and had lunch at a celebrated
house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have been the
most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help noticing 
even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives
and waiters clothes than in the steaks this collation disposed of at
a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we
went back to barnard s inn and got my little portmanteau and then took
coach for hammersmith we arrived there at two or three o clock in
the afternoon and had very little way to walk to mr pocket s house 
lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden
overlooking the river where mr pocket s children were playing
about and unless i deceive myself on a point where my interests or
prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that mr and mrs 
pocket s children were not growing up or being brought up but were
tumbling up 
mrs pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with
her legs upon another garden chair and mrs pocket s two nurse maids
were looking about them while the children played mamma said
herbert this is young mr pip upon which mrs pocket received me
with an appearance of amiable dignity 
 master alick and miss jane cried one of the nurses to two of the
children if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you ll fall over
into the river and be drownded and what ll your pa say then 
at the same time this nurse picked up mrs pocket s handkerchief and
said if that don t make six times you ve dropped it mum upon which
mrs pocket laughed and said thank you flopson and settling herself
in one chair only resumed her book her countenance immediately assumed
a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week 
but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eyes
upon me and said i hope your mamma is quite well this unexpected
inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i began saying in the
absurdest way that if there had been any such person i had no doubt she
would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and
would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue 
 well she cried picking up the pocket handkerchief if that don t
make seven times what are you a doing of this afternoon mum mrs 
pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable
surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of
recognition and said thank you flopson and forgot me and went on
reading 
i found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than
six little pockets present in various stages of tumbling up i had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region
of air wailing dolefully 
 if there ain t baby said flopson appearing to think it most
surprising make haste up millers 
millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees
the child s wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young
ventriloquist with something in its mouth mrs pocket read all the
time and i was curious to know what the book could be 
we were waiting i supposed for mr pocket to come out to us at any
rate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the
remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed
near mrs pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and
tumbled over her always very much to her momentary astonishment and
their own more enduring lamentation i was at a loss to account for
this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to
speculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby 
which baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to mrs 
pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over mrs pocket baby
and all and was caught by herbert and myself 
 gracious me flopson said mrs pocket looking off her book for a
moment everybody s tumbling 
 gracious you indeed mum returned flopson very red in the face 
 what have you got there 
 i got here flopson asked mrs pocket 
 why if it ain t your footstool cried flopson and if you keep it
under your skirts like that who s to help tumbling here take the
baby mum and give me your book 
mrs pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a
little in her lap while the other children played about it this had
lasted but a very short time when mrs pocket issued summary orders
that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap thus i made the
second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little
pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down 
under these circumstances when flopson and millers had got the children
into the house like a little flock of sheep and mr pocket came out
of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to find that mr 
pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face and
with his very gray hair disordered on his head as if he didn t quite
see his way to putting anything straight 
mr pocket said he was glad to see me and he hoped i was not sorry to
see him for i really am not he added with his son s smile 
 an alarming personage he was a young looking man in spite of
his perplexities and his very gray hair and his manner seemed quite
natural i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected 
there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have
been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very
near being so when he had talked with me a little he said to mrs 
pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were
black and handsome belinda i hope you have welcomed mr pip and she
looked up from her book and said yes she then smiled upon me in an
absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of orange flower
water as the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone
or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been thrown out like
her previous approaches in general conversational condescension 
i found out within a few hours and may mention at once that mrs 
pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased
father would have been made a baronet but for somebody s determined
opposition arising out of entirely personal motives i forget whose 
if i ever knew the sovereign s the prime minister s the lord
chancellor s the archbishop of canterbury s anybody s and had
tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
supposititious fact i believe he had been knighted himself for storming
the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address
engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of
some building or other and for handing some royal personage either the
trowel or the mortar be that as it may he had directed mrs pocket to
be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things
must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of
plebeian domestic knowledge 
so successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but
perfectly helpless and useless with her character thus happily formed 
in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered mr pocket who was
also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount
to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre as his doing the
one or the other was a mere question of time he and mrs pocket had
taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would
seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of
the judicious parent the judicious parent having nothing to bestow or
withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them
after a short struggle and had informed mr pocket that his wife was a
treasure for a prince mr pocket had invested the prince s treasure
in the ways of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought
him in but indifferent interest still mrs pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married
a title while mr pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach because he had never got one 
mr pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a
pleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for
my own private sitting room he then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name drummle
and startop drummle an old looking young man of a heavy order of
architecture was whistling startop younger in years and appearance 
was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge 
both mr and mrs pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
else s hands that i wondered who really was in possession of the house
and let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the
servants it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving
trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants
felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
drinking and to keep a deal of company down stairs they allowed a very
liberal table to mr and mrs pocket yet it always appeared to me that
by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been
the kitchen always supposing the boarder capable of self defence for 
before i had been there a week a neighboring lady with whom the family
were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen millers
slapping the baby this greatly distressed mrs pocket who burst into
tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing
that the neighbors couldn t mind their own business 
by degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert that mr pocket had been
educated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished himself 
but that when he had had the happiness of marrying mrs pocket very
early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling
of a grinder after grinding a number of dull blades of whom it was
remarkable that their fathers when influential were always going to
help him to preferment but always forgot to do it when the blades had
left the grindstone he had wearied of that poor work and had come to
london here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read 
with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them and had
refurbished divers others for special occasions and had turned his
acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction 
and on such means added to some very moderate private resources still
maintained the house i saw 
mr and mrs pocket had a toady neighbor a widow lady of that highly
sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody 
and shed smiles and tears on everybody according to circumstances this
lady s name was mrs coiler and i had the honor of taking her down to
dinner on the day of my installation she gave me to understand on the
stairs that it was a blow to dear mrs pocket that dear mr pocket
should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him 
that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence
 at that time i had known her something less than five minutes if
they were all like me it would be quite another thing 
 but dear mrs pocket said mrs coiler after her early
disappointment not that dear mr pocket was to blame in that requires
so much luxury and elegance 
 yes ma am i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to
cry 
 and she is of so aristocratic a disposition 
 yes ma am i said again with the same object as before 
 that it is hard said mrs coiler to have dear mr pocket s time
and attention diverted from dear mrs pocket 
i could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher s time
and attention were diverted from dear mrs pocket but i said nothing 
and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company
manners 
it came to my knowledge through what passed between mrs pocket and
drummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and
other instruments of self destruction that drummle whose christian
name was bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy 
it further appeared that the book i had seen mrs pocket reading in the
garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which
her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all 
drummle didn t say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky
kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognized mrs pocket
as a woman and a sister no one but themselves and mrs coiler the toady
neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it
appeared to me that it was painful to herbert but it promised to last
a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic
affliction it was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef to my
unutterable amazement i now for the first time saw mr pocket
relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very
extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and
with which i soon became as familiar as the rest he laid down the
carving knife and fork being engaged in carving at the moment put
his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an
extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it when he had done this 
and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he
was about 
mrs coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me i liked
it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the
pleasure was soon over she had a serpentine way of coming close at
me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities i had left which was altogether snaky and fork tongued and
when she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little to
her or upon drummle who said less i rather envied them for being on
the opposite side of the table 
after dinner the children were introduced and mrs coiler made admiring
comments on their eyes noses and legs a sagacious way of improving
their minds there were four little girls and two little boys besides
the baby who might have been either and the baby s next successor who
was as yet neither they were brought in by flopson and millers much as
though those two non commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere
for children and had enlisted these while mrs pocket looked at the
young nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had
had the pleasure of inspecting them before but didn t quite know what
to make of them 
 here give me your fork mum and take the baby said flopson don t
take it that way or you ll get its head under the table 
thus advised mrs pocket took it the other way and got its head
upon the table which was announced to all present by a prodigious
concussion 
 dear dear give it me back mum said flopson and miss jane come
and dance to baby do 
one of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place
by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and
laughed then all the children laughed and mr pocket who in the
meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair laughed 
and we all laughed and were glad 
flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll 
then got it safely into mrs pocket s lap and gave it the nut crackers
to play with at the same time recommending mrs pocket to take notice
that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its
eyes and sharply charging miss jane to look after the same then the
two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with
a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost
half his buttons at the gaming table 
i was made very uneasy in my mind by mrs pocket s falling into a
discussion with drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the
baby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nut crackers at
length little jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly
left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous
weapon away mrs pocket finishing her orange at about the same time 
and not approving of this said to jane 
 you naughty child how dare you go and sit down this instant 
 mamma dear lisped the little girl baby ood have put hith eyeth
out 
 how dare you tell me so retorted mrs pocket go and sit down in
your chair this moment 
mrs pocket s dignity was so crushing that i felt quite abashed as if
i myself had done something to rouse it 
 belinda remonstrated mr pocket from the other end of the table 
 how can you be so unreasonable jane only interfered for the protection
of baby 
 i will not allow anybody to interfere said mrs pocket i am
surprised matthew that you should expose me to the affront of
interference 
 good god cried mr pocket in an outbreak of desolate desperation 
 are infants to be nut crackered into their tombs and is nobody to save
them 
 i will not be interfered with by jane said mrs pocket with a
majestic glance at that innocent little offender i hope i know my poor
grandpapa s position jane indeed 
mr pocket got his hands in his hair again and this time really did
lift himself some inches out of his chair hear this he helplessly
exclaimed to the elements babies are to be nut crackered dead for
people s poor grandpapa s positions then he let himself down again 
and became silent 
we all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on a
pause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a
series of leaps and crows at little jane who appeared to me to be the
only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had
any decided acquaintance 
 mr drummle said mrs pocket will you ring for flopson jane you
undutiful little thing go and lie down now baby darling come with
ma 
the baby was the soul of honor and protested with all its might it
doubled itself up the wrong way over mrs pocket s arm exhibited a pair
of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft
face and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny and it gained
its point after all for i saw it through the window within a few
minutes being nursed by little jane 
it happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinner table through flopson s having some private engagement and
their not being anybody else s business i thus became aware of the
mutual relations between them and mr pocket which were exemplified in
the following manner mr pocket with the normal perplexity of his face
heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes as if
he couldn t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that
establishment and why they hadn t been billeted by nature on
somebody else then in a distant missionary way he asked them certain
questions as why little joe had that hole in his frill who said pa 
flopson was going to mend it when she had time and how little fanny
came by that whitlow who said pa millers was going to poultice it
when she didn t forget then he melted into parental tenderness and
gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as
they went out with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the
hair he dismissed the hopeless subject 
in the evening there was rowing on the river as drummle and startop had
each a boat i resolved to set up mine and to cut them both out i was
pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts but as
i was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the thames not to say
for other waters i at once engaged to place myself under the tuition
of the winner of a prize wherry who plied at our stairs and to whom i
was introduced by my new allies this practical authority confused me
very much by saying i had the arm of a blacksmith if he could have
known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil i doubt if he would
have paid it 
there was a supper tray after we got home at night and i think we
should all have enjoyed ourselves but for a rather disagreeable
domestic occurrence mr pocket was in good spirits when a housemaid
came in and said if you please sir i should wish to speak to you 
 speak to your master said mrs pocket whose dignity was roused
again how can you think of such a thing go and speak to flopson or
speak to me at some other time 
 begging your pardon ma am returned the housemaid i should wish to
speak at once and to speak to master 
hereupon mr pocket went out of the room and we made the best of
ourselves until he came back 
 this is a pretty thing belinda said mr pocket returning with a
countenance expressive of grief and despair here s the cook lying
insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor with a large bundle of fresh
butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease 
mrs pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion and said this is
that odious sophia s doing 
 what do you mean belinda demanded mr pocket 
 sophia has told you said mrs pocket did i not see her with my own
eyes and hear her with my own ears come into the room just now and ask
to speak to you 
 but has she not taken me down stairs belinda returned mr pocket 
 and shown me the woman and the bundle too 
 and do you defend her matthew said mrs pocket for making
mischief 
mr pocket uttered a dismal groan 
 am i grandpapa s granddaughter to be nothing in the house said mrs 
pocket besides the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman 
and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the
situation that she felt i was born to be a duchess 
there was a sofa where mr pocket stood and he dropped upon it in the
attitude of the dying gladiator still in that attitude he said with a
hollow voice good night mr pip when i deemed it advisable to go to
bed and leave him 
after two or three days when i had established myself in my room and
had gone backwards and forwards to london several times and had ordered
all i wanted of my tradesmen mr pocket and i had a long talk together 
he knew more of my intended career than i knew myself for he referred
to his having been told by mr jaggers that i was not designed for any
profession and that i should be well enough educated for my destiny
if i could hold my own with the average of young men in prosperous
circumstances i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary 
he advised my attending certain places in london for the acquisition of
such mere rudiments as i wanted and my investing him with the functions
of explainer and director of all my studies he hoped that with
intelligent assistance i should meet with little to discourage me and
should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his through his way
of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself on
confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and i may state
at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his
compact with me that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling
mine with him if he had shown indifference as a master i have no doubt
i should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no such
excuse and each of us did the other justice nor did i ever regard
him as having anything ludicrous about him or anything but what was
serious honest and good in his tutor communication with me 
when these points were settled and so far carried out as that i had
begun to work in earnest it occurred to me that if i could retain my
bedroom in barnard s inn my life would be agreeably varied while my
manners would be none the worse for herbert s society mr pocket did
not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could
possibly be taken in it it must be submitted to my guardian i felt
that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would
save herbert some expense so i went off to little britain and imparted
my wish to mr jaggers 
 if i could buy the furniture now hired for me said i and one or two
other little things i should be quite at home there 
 go it said mr jaggers with a short laugh i told you you d get on 
well how much do you want 
i said i didn t know how much 
 come retorted mr jaggers how much fifty pounds 
 o not nearly so much 
 five pounds said mr jaggers 
this was such a great fall that i said in discomfiture o more than
that 
 more than that eh retorted mr jaggers lying in wait for me with
his hands in his pockets his head on one side and his eyes on the wall
behind me how much more 
 it is so difficult to fix a sum said i hesitating 
 come said mr jaggers let s get at it twice five will that do 
three times five will that do four times five will that do 
i said i thought that would do handsomely 
 four times five will do handsomely will it said mr jaggers 
knitting his brows now what do you make of four times five 
 what do i make of it 
 ah said mr jaggers how much 
 i suppose you make it twenty pounds said i smiling 
 never mind what i make it my friend observed mr jaggers with a
knowing and contradictory toss of his head i want to know what you
make it 
 twenty pounds of course 
 wemmick said mr jaggers opening his office door take mr pip s
written order and pay him twenty pounds 
this strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked
impression on me and that not of an agreeable kind mr jaggers never
laughed but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising
himself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows
joined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to
creak as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way as he happened
to go out now and as wemmick was brisk and talkative i said to wemmick
that i hardly knew what to make of mr jaggers s manner 
 tell him that and he ll take it as a compliment answered wemmick 
 he don t mean that you should know what to make of it oh for
i looked surprised it s not personal it s professional only
professional 
wemmick was at his desk lunching and crunching on a dry hard biscuit 
pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as
if he were posting them 
 always seems to me said wemmick as if he had set a man trap and was
watching it suddenly click you re caught 
without remarking that man traps were not among the amenities of life i
said i supposed he was very skilful 
 deep said wemmick as australia pointing with his pen at the
office floor to express that australia was understood for the purposes
of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe 
 if there was anything deeper added wemmick bringing his pen to
paper he d be it 
then i said i supposed he had a fine business and wemmick said 
 ca pi tal then i asked if there were many clerks to which he
replied 
 we don t run much into clerks because there s only one jaggers and
people won t have him at second hand there are only four of us would
you like to see em you are one of us as i may say 
i accepted the offer when mr wemmick had put all the biscuit into the
post and had paid me my money from a cash box in a safe the key
of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his
coat collar like an iron pigtail we went up stairs the house was dark
and shabby and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in mr 
jaggers s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase
for years in the front first floor a clerk who looked something
between a publican and a rat catcher a large pale puffed swollen
man was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby
appearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to
be treated who contributed to mr jaggers s coffers getting evidence
together said mr wemmick as we came out for the bailey in the
room over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair
 his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was
similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes whom mr wemmick presented
to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt
me anything i pleased and who was in an excessive white perspiration 
as if he had been trying his art on himself in a back room a
high shouldered man with a face ache tied up in dirty flannel who was
dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been
waxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of
the other two gentlemen for mr jaggers s own use 
this was all the establishment when we went down stairs again wemmick
led me into my guardian s room and said this you ve seen already 
 pray said i as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
caught my sight again whose likenesses are those 
 these said wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off
the horrible heads before bringing them down these are two celebrated
ones famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit this chap
 why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the
inkstand to get this blot upon your eyebrow you old rascal murdered
his master and considering that he wasn t brought up to evidence 
didn t plan it badly 
 is it like him i asked recoiling from the brute as wemmick spat
upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve 
 like him it s himself you know the cast was made in newgate 
directly after he was taken down you had a particular fancy for
me hadn t you old artful said wemmick he then explained this
affectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady
and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying 
 had it made for me express 
 is the lady anybody said i 
 no returned wemmick only his game you liked your bit of game 
didn t you no deuce a bit of a lady in the case mr pip except
one and she wasn t of this slender lady like sort and you wouldn t
have caught her looking after this urn unless there was something to
drink in it wemmick s attention being thus directed to his brooch he
put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pocket handkerchief 
 did that other creature come to the same end i asked he has the
same look 
 you re right said wemmick it s the genuine look much as if one
nostril was caught up with a horse hair and a little fish hook yes 
he came to the same end quite the natural end here i assure you 
he forged wills this blade did if he didn t also put the supposed
testators to sleep too you were a gentlemanly cove though mr 
wemmick was again apostrophizing and you said you could write greek 
yah bounceable what a liar you were i never met such a liar as you 
before putting his late friend on his shelf again wemmick touched the
largest of his mourning rings and said sent out to buy it for me only
the day before 
while he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair 
the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived
from like sources as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i
ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before
me dusting his hands 
 o yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind one brings
another you see that s the way of it i always take em they re
curiosities and they re property they may not be worth much but 
after all they re property and portable it don t signify to you with
your brilliant lookout but as to myself my guiding star always is 
 get hold of portable property 
when i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a
friendly manner 
 if at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldn t
mind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i
should consider it an honor i have not much to show you but such two
or three curiosities as i have got you might like to look over and i am
fond of a bit of garden and a summer house 
i said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality 
 thankee said he then we ll consider that it s to come off when
convenient to you have you dined with mr jaggers yet 
 not yet 
 well said wemmick he ll give you wine and good wine i ll give you
punch and not bad punch and now i ll tell you something when you go
to dine with mr jaggers look at his housekeeper 
 shall i see something very uncommon 
 well said wemmick you ll see a wild beast tamed not so very
uncommon you ll tell me i reply that depends on the original wildness
of the beast and the amount of taming it won t lower your opinion of
mr jaggers s powers keep your eye on it 
i told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his
preparation awakened as i was taking my departure he asked me if i
would like to devote five minutes to seeing mr jaggers at it 
for several reasons and not least because i didn t clearly know what
mr jaggers would be found to be at i replied in the affirmative 
we dived into the city and came up in a crowded police court where
a blood relation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the
fanciful taste in brooches was standing at the bar uncomfortably
chewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or
cross examination i don t know which and was striking her and
the bench and everybody present with awe if anybody of whatsoever
degree said a word that he didn t approve of he instantly required to
have it taken down if anybody wouldn t make an admission he said 
 i ll have it out of you and if anybody made an admission he said 
 now i have got you the magistrates shivered under a single bite of
his finger thieves and thief takers hung in dread rapture on his words 
and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction which
side he was on i couldn t make out for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill i only know that when i stole out on tiptoe 
he was not on the side of the bench for he was making the legs of the
old gentleman who presided quite convulsive under the table by his
denunciations of his conduct as the representative of british law and
justice in that chair that day 
bentley drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book
as if its writer had done him an injury did not take up an
acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit heavy in figure movement 
and comprehension in the sluggish complexion of his face and in
the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as
he himself lolled about in a room he was idle proud niggardly 
reserved and suspicious he came of rich people down in somersetshire 
who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the
discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead thus bentley drummle
had come to mr pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman 
and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen 
startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he
ought to have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and
admired her beyond measure he had a woman s delicacy of feature 
and was as you may see though you never saw her said herbert to
me exactly like his mother it was but natural that i should take to
him much more kindly than to drummle and that even in the earliest
evenings of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one
another conversing from boat to boat while bentley drummle came up
in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes he
would always creep in shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature 
even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and i always
think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back water 
when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in
mid stream 
herbert was my intimate companion and friend i presented him with a
half share in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down
to hammersmith and my possession of a half share in his chambers often
took me up to london we used to walk between the two places at all
hours i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so
pleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of untried
youth and hope 
when i had been in mr pocket s family a month or two mr and mrs 
camilla turned up camilla was mr pocket s sister georgiana whom i
had seen at miss havisham s on the same occasion also turned up she
was a cousin an indigestive single woman who called her rigidity
religion and her liver love these people hated me with the hatred of
cupidity and disappointment as a matter of course they fawned upon
me in my prosperity with the basest meanness towards mr pocket as
a grown up infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the
complacent forbearance i had heard them express mrs pocket they
held in contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily
disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon
themselves 
these were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied
myself to my education i soon contracted expensive habits and began
to spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should have
thought almost fabulous but through good and evil i stuck to my books 
there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel
my deficiencies between mr pocket and herbert i got on fast and with
one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i wanted and
clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as great a dolt as
drummle if i had done less 
i had not seen mr wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write
him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening he
replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect
me at the office at six o clock thither i went and there i found him 
putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck 
 did you think of walking down to walworth said he 
 certainly said i if you approve 
 very much was wemmick s reply for i have had my legs under the desk
all day and shall be glad to stretch them now i ll tell you what i
have got for supper mr pip i have got a stewed steak which is
of home preparation and a cold roast fowl which is from the
cook s shop i think it s tender because the master of the shop was a
juryman in some cases of ours the other day and we let him down easy 
i reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said pick us out
a good one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box
another day or two we could easily have done it he said to that 
 let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop i let him of
course as far as it goes it s property and portable you don t object
to an aged parent i hope 
i really thought he was still speaking of the fowl until he added 
 because i have got an aged parent at my place i then said what
politeness required 
 so you haven t dined with mr jaggers yet he pursued as we walked
along 
 not yet 
 he told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming i expect
you ll have an invitation to morrow he s going to ask your pals too 
three of em ain t there 
although i was not in the habit of counting drummle as one of my
intimate associates i answered yes 
 well he s going to ask the whole gang i hardly felt complimented by
the word and whatever he gives you he ll give you good don t look
forward to variety but you ll have excellence and there s another rum
thing in his house proceeded wemmick after a moment s pause as if
the remark followed on the housekeeper understood he never lets a door
or window be fastened at night 
 is he never robbed 
 that s it returned wemmick he says and gives it out publicly i
want to see the man who ll rob me lord bless you i have heard him a
hundred times if i have heard him once say to regular cracksmen in our
front office you know where i live now no bolt is ever drawn there 
why don t you do a stroke of business with me come can t i tempt you 
not a man of them sir would be bold enough to try it on for love or
money 
 they dread him so much said i 
 dread him said wemmick i believe you they dread him not but what
he s artful even in his defiance of them no silver sir britannia
metal every spoon 
 so they wouldn t have much i observed even if they 
 ah but he would have much said wemmick cutting me short and they
know it he d have their lives and the lives of scores of em he d
have all he could get and it s impossible to say what he couldn t get 
if he gave his mind to it 
i was falling into meditation on my guardian s greatness when wemmick
remarked 
 as to the absence of plate that s only his natural depth you know 
a river s its natural depth and he s his natural depth look at his
watch chain that s real enough 
 it s very massive said i 
 massive repeated wemmick i think so and his watch is a gold
repeater and worth a hundred pound if it s worth a penny mr pip 
there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about
that watch there s not a man a woman or a child among them who
wouldn t identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it
was red hot if inveigled into touching it 
at first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more
general nature did mr wemmick and i beguile the time and the road 
until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of
walworth 
it appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little
gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement 
wemmick s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted
with guns 
 my own doing said wemmick looks pretty don t it 
i highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw 
with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham 
and a gothic door almost too small to get in at 
 that s a real flagstaff you see said wemmick and on sundays i
run up a real flag then look here after i have crossed this bridge i
hoist it up so and cut off the communication 
the bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide
and two deep but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he
hoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so with a relish and
not merely mechanically 
 at nine o clock every night greenwich time said wemmick the gun
fires there he is you see and when you hear him go i think you ll
say he s a stinger 
the piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress 
constructed of lattice work it was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella 
 then at the back said wemmick out of sight so as not to impede
the idea of fortifications for it s a principle with me if you have
an idea carry it out and keep it up i don t know whether that s your
opinion 
i said decidedly 
 at the back there s a pig and there are fowls and rabbits then 
i knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers and
you ll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise so sir said
wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you
can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a
time in point of provisions 
then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was
approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long
time to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth 
our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower
was raised this piece of water with an island in the middle which
might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had
constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going
and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it
made the back of your hand quite wet 
 i am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and
my own gardener and my own jack of all trades said wemmick in
acknowledging my compliments well it s a good thing you know it
brushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged you wouldn t
mind being at once introduced to the aged would you it wouldn t put
you out 
i expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle there
we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat clean 
cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf 
 well aged parent said wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial
and jocose way how am you 
 all right john all right replied the old man 
 here s mr pip aged parent said wemmick and i wish you could hear
his name nod away at him mr pip that s what he likes nod away at
him if you please like winking 
 this is a fine place of my son s sir cried the old man while i
nodded as hard as i possibly could this is a pretty pleasure ground 
sir this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept
together by the nation after my son s time for the people s
enjoyment 
 you re as proud of it as punch ain t you aged said wemmick 
contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened there s
a nod for you giving him a tremendous one there s another for you 
giving him a still more tremendous one you like that don t you if
you re not tired mr pip though i know it s tiring to strangers will
you tip him one more you can t think how it pleases him 
i tipped him several more and he was in great spirits we left him
bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in
the arbor where wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken
him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of
perfection 
 is it your own mr wemmick 
 o yes said wemmick i have got hold of it a bit at a time it s a
freehold by george 
 is it indeed i hope mr jaggers admires it 
 never seen it said wemmick never heard of it never seen the aged 
never heard of him no the office is one thing and private life is
another when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and
when i come into the castle i leave the office behind me if it s not
in any way disagreeable to you you ll oblige me by doing the same i
don t wish it professionally spoken about 
of course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his
request the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and
talking until it was almost nine o clock getting near gun fire said
wemmick then as he laid down his pipe it s the aged s treat 
proceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker 
with expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great
nightly ceremony wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the
moment was come for him to take the red hot poker from the aged and
repair to the battery he took it and went out and presently the
stinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a
cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in
it ring upon this the aged who i believe would have been blown out
of his arm chair but for holding on by the elbows cried out exultingly 
 he s fired i heerd him and i nodded at the old gentleman until it is
no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him 
the interval between that time and supper wemmick devoted to showing
me his collection of curiosities they were mostly of a felonious
character comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been
committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several
manuscript confessions written under condemnation upon which mr 
wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words every one
of em lies sir these were agreeably dispersed among small specimens
of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the
museum and some tobacco stoppers carved by the aged they were all
displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had been first
inducted and which served not only as the general sitting room but
as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan on the hob and
a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a
roasting jack 
there was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged in
the day when she had laid the supper cloth the bridge was lowered to
give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night the supper was
excellent and though the castle was rather subject to dry rot insomuch
that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been
farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment nor was
there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such
a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when i lay down
on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that pole on my
forehead all night 
wemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him
cleaning my boots after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from
my gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in
a most devoted manner our breakfast was as good as the supper and at
half past eight precisely we started for little britain by degrees 
wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened
into a post office again at last when we got to his place of business
and he pulled out his key from his coat collar he looked as unconscious
of his walworth property as if the castle and the drawbridge and the
arbor and the lake and the fountain and the aged had all been blown
into space together by the last discharge of the stinger 
it fell out as wemmick had told me it would that i had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardian s establishment with that of his
cashier and clerk my guardian was in his room washing his hands with
his scented soap when i went into the office from walworth and he
called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
which wemmick had prepared me to receive no ceremony he stipulated 
 and no dinner dress and say to morrow i asked him where we should
come to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his
general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied 
 come here and i ll take you home with me i embrace this opportunity
of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or
a dentist he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which
smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer s shop it had an unusually
large jack towel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his
hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came
in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room when i and
my friends repaired to him at six o clock next day he seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found
him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hands 
but laving his face and gargling his throat and even when he had
done all that and had gone all round the jack towel he took out his
penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat
on 
there were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was
something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled
his presence that they gave it up for that day as we walked along
westward he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of
the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but
he never otherwise recognized anybody or took notice that anybody
recognized him 
he conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side of
that street rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want
of painting and with dirty windows he took out his key and opened the
door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used 
so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on
the first floor there were carved garlands on the panelled walls and
as he stood among them giving us welcome i know what kind of loops i
thought they looked like 
dinner was laid in the best of these rooms the second was his
dressing room the third his bedroom he told us that he held the whole
house but rarely used more of it than we saw the table was comfortably
laid no silver in the service of course and at the side of his chair
was a capacious dumb waiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on
it and four dishes of fruit for dessert i noticed throughout that he
kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself 
there was a bookcase in the room i saw from the backs of the books 
that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials 
acts of parliament and such things the furniture was all very solid
and good like his watch chain it had an official look however and
there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen in a corner was a little
table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring the
office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an
evening and fall to work 
as he had scarcely seen my three companions until now for he and i had
walked together he stood on the hearth rug after ringing the bell 
and took a searching look at them to my surprise he seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in drummle 
 pip said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
the window i don t know one from the other who s the spider 
 the spider said i 
 the blotchy sprawly sulky fellow 
 that s bentley drummle i replied the one with the delicate face is
startop 
not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he
returned bentley drummle is his name is it i like the look of that
fellow 
he immediately began to talk to drummle not at all deterred by his
replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw
discourse out of him i was looking at the two when there came between
me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table 
she was a woman of about forty i supposed but i may have thought her
younger than she was rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely
pale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair i cannot
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be
parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression
of suddenness and flutter but i know that i had been to see macbeth at
the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if
it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces i had seen rise out
of the witches caldron 
she set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished we took our seats
at the round table and my guardian kept drummle on one side of him 
while startop sat on the other it was a noble dish of fish that the
housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice
mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird sauces wines all
the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our
host from his dumb waiter and when they had made the circuit of the
table he always put them back again similarly he dealt us clean
plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just
disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair no other attendant
than the housekeeper appeared she set on every dish and i always saw
in her face a face rising out of the caldron years afterwards i made
a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other
natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room 
induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her
own striking appearance and by wemmick s preparation i observed
that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my
guardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put
before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and
wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say i
fancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a
purpose of always holding her in suspense 
dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
than originate subjects i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of
our dispositions out of us for myself i found that i was expressing my
tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronize herbert and to boast
of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my lips 
it was so with all of us but with no one more than drummle the
development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off 
it was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that drummle was rallied
for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his 
drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to
our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that
as to strength he could scatter us like chaff by some invisible agency 
my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this
trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular
it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous
manner 
now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian 
taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her 
was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and
showing an interest in drummle that to me was quite inexplicable 
suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper s like a trap 
as she stretched it across the table so suddenly and smartly did he do
this that we all stopped in our foolish contention 
 if you talk of strength said mr jaggers i ll show you a wrist 
molly let them see your wrist 
her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other
hand behind her waist master she said in a low voice with her eyes
attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him don t 
 i ll show you a wrist repeated mr jaggers with an immovable
determination to show it molly let them see your wrist 
 master she again murmured please 
 molly said mr jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking
at the opposite side of the room let them see both your wrists show
them come 
he took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table she
brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by
side the last wrist was much disfigured deeply scarred and scarred
across and across when she held her hands out she took her eyes from
mr jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
in succession 
 there s power here said mr jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews
with his forefinger very few men have the power of wrist that this
woman has it s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
hands i have had occasion to notice many hands but i never saw
stronger in that respect man s or woman s than these 
while he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued
to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat the moment
he ceased she looked at him again that ll do molly said mr 
jaggers giving her a slight nod you have been admired and can
go she withdrew her hands and went out of the room and mr jaggers 
putting the decanters on from his dumb waiter filled his glass and
passed round the wine 
 at half past nine gentlemen said he we must break up pray make
the best use of your time i am glad to see you all mr drummle i
drink to you 
if his object in singling out drummle were to bring him out still more 
it perfectly succeeded in a sulky triumph drummle showed his morose
depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree 
until he became downright intolerable through all his stages mr 
jaggers followed him with the same strange interest he actually seemed
to serve as a zest to mr jaggers s wine 
in our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink 
and i know we talked too much we became particularly hot upon some
boorish sneer of drummle s to the effect that we were too free with our
money it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it
came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my
presence but a week or so before 
 well retorted drummle he ll be paid 
 i don t mean to imply that he won t said i but it might make you
hold your tongue about us and our money i should think 
 you should think retorted drummle oh lord 
 i dare say i went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldn t
lend money to any of us if we wanted it 
 you are right said drummle i wouldn t lend one of you a sixpence i
wouldn t lend anybody a sixpence 
 rather mean to borrow under those circumstances i should say 
 you should say repeated drummle oh lord 
this was so very aggravating the more especially as i found myself
making no way against his surly obtuseness that i said disregarding
herbert s efforts to check me 
 come mr drummle since we are on the subject i ll tell you what
passed between herbert here and me when you borrowed that money 
 i don t want to know what passed between herbert there and you 
growled drummle and i think he added in a lower growl that we might
both go to the devil and shake ourselves 
 i ll tell you however said i whether you want to know or not we
said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed
to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it 
drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands
in his pockets and his round shoulders raised plainly signifying that
it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all 
hereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than
i had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable startop 
being a lively bright young fellow and drummle being the exact
opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct
personal affront he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop
tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
us all laugh resenting this little success more than anything drummle 
without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his pockets 
dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and would
have flung it at his adversary s head but for our entertainer s
dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
purpose 
 gentlemen said mr jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and
hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain i am exceedingly
sorry to announce that it s half past nine 
on this hint we all rose to depart before we got to the street door 
startop was cheerily calling drummle old boy as if nothing had
happened but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not
even walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way so herbert and i 
who remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite sides 
startop leading and drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses 
much as he was wont to follow in his boat 
as the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert there for
a moment and run up stairs again to say a word to my guardian i found
him in his dressing room surrounded by his stock of boots already hard
at it washing his hands of us 
i told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything
disagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame
me much 
 pooh said he sluicing his face and speaking through the
water drops it s nothing pip i like that spider though 
he had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing and
towelling himself 
 i am glad you like him sir said i but i don t 
 no no my guardian assented don t have too much to do with him 
keep as clear of him as you can but i like the fellow pip he is one
of the true sort why if i was a fortune teller 
looking out of the towel he caught my eye 
 but i am not a fortune teller he said letting his head drop into a
festoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears you know what i
am don t you good night pip 
 good night sir 
in about a month after that the spider s time with mr pocket was up
for good and to the great relief of all the house but mrs pocket he
went home to the family hole 
 my dear mr pip 
 i write this by request of mr gargery for to let you know that he
is going to london in company with mr wopsle and would be glad if
agreeable to be allowed to see you he would call at barnard s hotel
tuesday morning at nine o clock when if not agreeable please leave
word your poor sister is much the same as when you left we talk of you
in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing if
now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of
poor old days no more dear mr pip from your ever obliged and
affectionate servant 
 biddy 
 p s he wishes me most particular to write what larks he says you will
understand i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him 
even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a
worthy worthy man i have read him all excepting only the last little
sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks 
i received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its
appointment was for next day let me confess exactly with what feelings
i looked forward to joe s coming 
not with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties no 
with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of
incongruity if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly
would have paid money my greatest reassurance was that he was coming
to barnard s inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall
in bentley drummle s way i had little objection to his being seen by
herbert or his father for both of whom i had a respect but i had the
sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by drummle whom i held in
contempt so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise 
i had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those
wrestles with barnard proved to be by this time the rooms were
vastly different from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honor
of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring
upholsterer i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a boy
in boots top boots in bondage and slavery to whom i might have been
said to pass my days for after i had made the monster out of the
refuse of my washerwoman s family and had clothed him with a blue
coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots
already mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal
to eat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my
existence 
this avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday
morning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for
floorcloth and herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he
thought joe would like while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being
so interested and considerate i had an odd half provoked sense of
suspicion upon me that if joe had been coming to see him he wouldn t
have been quite so brisk about it 
however i came into town on the monday night to be ready for joe and
i got up early in the morning and caused the sitting room and
breakfast table to assume their most splendid appearance unfortunately
the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact
that barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak
giant of a sweep 
as the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger
pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard joe on
the staircase i knew it was joe by his clumsy manner of coming up
stairs his state boots being always too big for him and by the time
it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of
his ascent when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his
finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards
distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole finally he gave a
faint single rap and pepper such was the compromising name of the
avenging boy announced mr gargery i thought he never would have
done wiping his feet and that i must have gone out to lift him off the
mat but at last he came in 
 joe how are you joe 
 pip how air you pip 
with his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put
down on the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them
straight up and down as if i had been the last patented pump 
 i am glad to see you joe give me your hat 
but joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a bird s nest with
eggs in it wouldn t hear of parting with that piece of property and
persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way 
 which you have that growed said joe and that swelled and that
gentle folked joe considered a little before he discovered this word 
 as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country 
 and you joe look wonderfully well 
 thank god said joe i m ekerval to most and your sister she s
no worse than she were and biddy she s ever right and ready and all
friends is no backerder if not no forarder ceptin wopsle he s had a
drop 
all this time still with both hands taking great care of the
bird s nest joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and
round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing gown 
 had a drop joe 
 why yes said joe lowering his voice he s left the church and went
into the playacting which the playacting have likeways brought him
to london along with me and his wish were said joe getting the
bird s nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an
egg with his right if no offence as i would and you that 
i took what joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled play bill of
a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that
very week of the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown 
whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national bard
has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles 
 were you at his performance joe i inquired 
 i were said joe with emphasis and solemnity 
 was there a great sensation 
 why said joe yes there certainly were a peck of orange peel 
partickler when he see the ghost though i put it to yourself sir 
whether it were calc lated to keep a man up to his work with a good
hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with
 amen a man may have had a misfortun and been in the church said
joe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but
that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time which i
meantersay if the ghost of a man s own father cannot be allowed to
claim his attention what can sir still more when his mourning at
is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers
brings it off try to keep it on how you may 
a ghost seeing effect in joe s own countenance informed me that herbert
had entered the room so i presented joe to herbert who held out his
hand but joe backed from it and held on by the bird s nest 
 your servant sir said joe which i hope as you and pip here his
eye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so
plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the
family that i frowned it down and confused him more i meantersay you
two gentlemen which i hope as you get your elths in this close spot 
for the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinions 
said joe confidentially and i believe its character do stand i but i
wouldn t keep a pig in it myself not in the case that i wished him to
fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him 
having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwelling place and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me
 sir joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat as if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting place and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimney piece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals 
 do you take tea or coffee mr gargery asked herbert who always
presided of a morning 
 thankee sir said joe stiff from head to foot i ll take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself 
 what do you say to coffee 
 thankee sir returned joe evidently dispirited by the proposal 
 since you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run contrairy
to your own opinions but don t you never find it a little eating 
 say tea then said herbert pouring it out 
here joe s hat tumbled off the mantel piece and he started out of his
chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot as if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again
soon 
 when did you come to town mr gargery 
 were it yesterday afternoon said joe after coughing behind his hand 
as if he had had time to catch the whooping cough since he came no
it were not yes it were yes it were yesterday afternoon with an
appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality 
 have you seen anything of london yet 
 why yes sir said joe me and wopsle went off straight to look at
the blacking ware us but we didn t find that it come up to its likeness
in the red bills at the shop doors which i meantersay added joe in
an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral 
i really believe joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive
to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect chorus but
for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which
was toppling indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a
quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicket keeping 
he made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill now 
rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped now merely stopping
it midway beating it up and humoring it in various parts of the room
and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall 
before he felt it safe to close with it finally splashing it into the
slop basin where i took the liberty of laying hands upon it 
as to his shirt collar and his coat collar they were perplexing to
reflect upon insoluble mysteries both why should a man scrape himself
to that extent before he could consider himself full dressed why
should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for
his holiday clothes then he fell into such unaccountable fits of
meditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth had
his eyes attracted in such strange directions was afflicted with such
remarkable coughs sat so far from the table and dropped so much
more than he ate and pretended that he hadn t dropped it that i was
heartily glad when herbert left us for the city 
i had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was
all my fault and that if i had been easier with joe joe would have
been easier with me i felt impatient of him and out of temper with him 
in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head 
 us two being now alone sir began joe 
 joe i interrupted pettishly how can you call me sir 
joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars
were i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look 
 us two being now alone resumed joe and me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now conclude leastways
begin to mention what have led to my having had the present honor for
was it not said joe with his old air of lucid exposition that my
only wish were to be useful to you i should not have had the honor of
breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen 
i was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance
against this tone 
 well sir pursued joe this is how it were i were at the bargemen
t other night pip whenever he subsided into affection he called me
pip and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir when
there come up in his shay cart pumblechook which that same identical 
said joe going down a new track do comb my air the wrong way
sometimes awful by giving out up and down town as it were him which
ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow
by yourself 
 nonsense it was you joe 
 which i fully believed it were pip said joe slightly tossing
his head though it signify little now sir well pip this same
identical which his manners is given to blusterous come to me at
the bargemen wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the
workingman sir and do not over stimilate and his word were joseph 
miss havisham she wish to speak to you 
 miss havisham joe 
 she wish were pumblechook s word to speak to you joe sat and
rolled his eyes at the ceiling 
 yes joe go on please 
 next day sir said joe looking at me as if i were a long way off 
 having cleaned myself i go and i see miss a 
 miss a joe miss havisham 
 which i say sir replied joe with an air of legal formality as if
he were making his will miss a or otherways havisham her expression
air then as follering mr gargery you air in correspondence with mr 
pip having had a letter from you i were able to say i am when
i married your sister sir i said i will and when i answered your
friend pip i said i am would you tell him then said she that
which estella has come home and would be glad to see him 
i felt my face fire up as i looked at joe i hope one remote cause
of its firing may have been my consciousness that if i had known his
errand i should have given him more encouragement 
 biddy pursued joe when i got home and asked her fur to write the
message to you a little hung back biddy says i know he will be very
glad to have it by word of mouth it is holiday time you want to see
him go i have now concluded sir said joe rising from his chair 
 and pip i wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a
greater height 
 but you are not going now joe 
 yes i am said joe 
 but you are coming back to dinner joe 
 no i am not said joe 
our eyes met and all the sir melted out of that manly heart as he gave
me his hand 
 pip dear old chap life is made of ever so many partings welded
together as i may say and one man s a blacksmith and one s a
whitesmith and one s a goldsmith and one s a coppersmith diwisions
among such must come and must be met as they come if there s been
any fault at all to day it s mine you and me is not two figures to
be together in london nor yet anywheres else but what is private and
beknown and understood among friends it ain t that i am proud but
that i want to be right as you shall never see me no more in these
clothes i m wrong in these clothes i m wrong out of the forge the
kitchen or off th meshes you won t find half so much fault in me if
you think of me in my forge dress with my hammer in my hand or even
my pipe you won t find half so much fault in me if supposing as you
should ever wish to see me you come and put your head in at the forge
window and see joe the blacksmith there at the old anvil in the old
burnt apron sticking to the old work i m awful dull but i hope i ve
beat out something nigh the rights of this at last and so god bless
you dear old pip old chap god bless you 
i had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity
in him the fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he
spoke these words than it could come in its way in heaven he touched me
gently on the forehead and went out as soon as i could recover
myself sufficiently i hurried out after him and looked for him in the
neighboring streets but he was gone 
it was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first
flow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at joe s 
but when i had secured my box place by to morrow s coach and had been
down to mr pocket s and back i was not by any means convinced on the
last point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting
up at the blue boar i should be an inconvenience at joe s i was not
expected and my bed would not be ready i should be too far from
miss havisham s and she was exacting and mightn t like it all other
swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self swindlers and with such
pretences did i cheat myself surely a curious thing that i should
innocently take a bad half crown of somebody else s manufacture is
reasonable enough but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
of my own make as good money an obliging stranger under pretence of
compactly folding up my bank notes for security s sake abstracts the
notes and gives me nutshells but what is his sleight of hand to mine 
when i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes 
having settled that i must go to the blue boar my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger it was
tempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots
in the archway of the blue boar s posting yard it was almost solemn to
imagine him casually produced in the tailor s shop and confounding
the disrespectful senses of trabb s boy on the other hand trabb s boy
might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things or reckless
and desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high
street my patroness too might hear of him and not approve on the
whole i resolved to leave the avenger behind 
it was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter
had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until two or
three hours after dark our time of starting from the cross keys was
two o clock i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare 
attended by the avenger if i may connect that expression with one who
never attended on me if he could possibly help it 
at that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dock yards
by stage coach as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
passengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
their ironed legs over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised
when herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two
convicts going down with me but i had a reason that was an old reason
now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word convict 
 you don t mind them handel said herbert 
 o no 
 i thought you seemed as if you didn t like them 
 i can t pretend that i do like them and i suppose you don t
particularly but i don t mind them 
 see there they are said herbert coming out of the tap what a
degraded and vile sight it is 
they had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler
with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands 
the two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their
legs irons of a pattern that i knew well they wore the dress that i
likewise knew well their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried
a thick knobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good
understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at
the putting to of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts were
an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the
curator one was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared
as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the world 
both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of
clothes his arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes 
and his attire disguised him absurdly but i knew his half closed eye
at one glance there stood the man whom i had seen on the settle at the
three jolly bargemen on a saturday night and who had brought me down
with his invisible gun 
it was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had
never seen me in his life he looked across at me and his eye appraised
my watch chain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the
other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink
of their coupling manacle and looked at something else the great
numbers on their backs as if they were street doors their coarse mangy
ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals their ironed
legs apologetically garlanded with pocket handkerchiefs and the way
in which all present looked at them and kept from them made them as
herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle 
but this was not the worst of it it came out that the whole of the back
of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and that
there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front
behind the coachman hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the
fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said
that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous
company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and
shameful and i don t know what else at this time the coach was ready
and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and
the prisoners had come over with their keeper bringing with them that
curious flavor of bread poultice baize rope yarn and hearthstone 
which attends the convict presence 
 don t take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger i ll sit next you myself i ll put em on the outside of
the row they won t interfere with you sir you needn t know they re
there 
 and don t blame me growled the convict i had recognized i don t
want to go i am quite ready to stay behind as fur as i am concerned
any one s welcome to my place 
 or mine said the other gruffly i wouldn t have incommoded none
of you if i d had my way then they both laughed and began cracking
nuts and spitting the shells about as i really think i should have
liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so despised 
at length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman 
and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind so he
got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the
place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they
could and the convict i had recognized sat behind me with his breath on
the hair of my head 
 good by handel herbert called out as we started i thought what a
blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than pip 
it is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convict s
breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine the
sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
searching acid it set my very teeth on edge he seemed to have more
breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in
doing it and i was conscious of growing high shouldered on one side in
my shrinking endeavors to fend him off 
the weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold it made us
all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the half way
house behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent i dozed
off myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a
couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him 
and how it could best be done in the act of dipping forward as if i
were going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the
question up again 
but i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although
i could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
blew at us cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
the wind the convicts were closer to me than before the very first
words i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the words of
my own thought two one pound notes 
 how did he get em said the convict i had never seen 
 how should i know returned the other he had em stowed away
somehows giv him by friends i expect 
 i wish said the other with a bitter curse upon the cold that i had
 em here 
 two one pound notes or friends 
 two one pound notes i d sell all the friends i ever had for one and
think it a blessed good bargain well so he says 
 so he says resumed the convict i had recognized it was all
said and done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the
dock yard you re a going to be discharged yes i was would i find
out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two
one pound notes yes i would and i did 
 more fool you growled the other i d have spent em on a man in
wittles and drink he must have been a green one mean to say he knowed
nothing of you 
 not a ha porth different gangs and different ships he was tried again
for prison breaking and got made a lifer 
 and was that honor the only time you worked out in this part of the
country 
 the only time 
 what might have been your opinion of the place 
 a most beastly place mudbank mist swamp and work work swamp 
mist and mudbank 
they both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually
growled themselves out and had nothing left to say 
after overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and
been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling
certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity indeed i was not
only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and
so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could
have known me without accidental help still the coincidence of our
being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his
hearing with my name for this reason i resolved to alight as soon as
we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing this device i
executed successfully my little portmanteau was in the boot under my
feet i had but to turn a hinge to get it out i threw it down before
me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first
stones of the town pavement as to the convicts they went their way
with the coach and i knew at what point they would be spirited off to
the river in my fancy i saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for
them at the slime washed stairs again heard the gruff give way you 
like and order to dogs again saw the wicked noah s ark lying out on
the black water 
i could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether
undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me as i walked on to
the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension of
a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble i am confident
that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the revival for a
few minutes of the terror of childhood 
the coffee room at the blue boar was empty and i had not only ordered
my dinner there but had sat down to it before the waiter knew me as
soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory he asked me
if he should send boots for mr pumblechook 
 no said i certainly not 
the waiter it was he who had brought up the great remonstrance from the
commercials on the day when i was bound appeared surprised and
took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local
newspaper so directly in my way that i took it up and read this
paragraph 
our readers will learn not altogether without interest in reference to
the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this
neighborhood what a theme by the way for the magic pen of our as yet
not universally acknowledged townsman tooby the poet of our columns 
that the youth s earliest patron companion and friend was a highly
respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed
trade and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises
are situate within a hundred miles of the high street it is not wholly
irrespective of our personal feelings that we record him as the mentor
of our young telemachus for it is good to know that our town produced
the founder of the latter s fortunes does the thought contracted brow
of the local sage or the lustrous eye of local beauty inquire whose
fortunes we believe that quintin matsys was the blacksmith of antwerp 
verb sap 
i entertain a conviction based upon large experience that if in the
days of my prosperity i had gone to the north pole i should have met
somebody there wandering esquimaux or civilized man who would have
told me that pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my
fortunes 
betimes in the morning i was up and out it was too early yet to go to
miss havisham s so i loitered into the country on miss havisham s
side of town which was not joe s side i could go there
to morrow thinking about my patroness and painting brilliant pictures
of her plans for me 
she had adopted estella she had as good as adopted me and it could not
fail to be her intention to bring us together she reserved it for me to
restore the desolate house admit the sunshine into the dark rooms 
set the clocks a going and the cold hearths a blazing tear down the
cobwebs destroy the vermin in short do all the shining deeds of the
young knight of romance and marry the princess i had stopped to
look at the house as i passed and its seared red brick walls blocked
windows and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with
its twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arms had made up a rich
attractive mystery of which i was the hero estella was the inspiration
of it and the heart of it of course but though she had taken such
strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so set upon
her though her influence on my boyish life and character had been
all powerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her with any
attributes save those she possessed i mention this in this place of a
fixed purpose because it is the clew by which i am to be followed into
my poor labyrinth according to my experience the conventional notion
of a lover cannot be always true the unqualified truth is that when i
loved estella with the love of a man i loved her simply because i found
her irresistible once for all i knew to my sorrow often and often 
if not always that i loved her against reason against promise against
peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that
could be once for all i loved her none the less because i knew it 
and it had no more influence in restraining me than if i had devoutly
believed her to be human perfection 
i so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time when
i had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the
gate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart
moderately quiet i heard the side door open and steps come across the
courtyard but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its
rusty hinges 
being at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned i started
much more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober
gray dress the last man i should have expected to see in that place of
porter at miss havisham s door 
 orlick 
 ah young master there s more changes than yours but come in come
in it s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open 
i entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out yes 
said he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards
the house here i am 
 how did you come here 
 i come her he retorted on my legs i had my box brought alongside
me in a barrow 
 are you here for good 
 i ain t here for harm young master i suppose 
i was not so sure of that i had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my
legs and arms to my face 
 then you have left the forge i said 
 do this look like a forge replied orlick sending his glance all
round him with an air of injury now do it look like it 
i asked him how long he had left gargery s forge 
 one day is so like another here he replied that i don t know
without casting it up however i come here some time since you left 
 i could have told you that orlick 
 ah said he dryly but then you ve got to be a scholar 
by this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one
just within the side door with a little window in it looking on the
courtyard in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of place
usually assigned to a gate porter in paris certain keys were hanging on
the wall to which he now added the gate key and his patchwork covered
bed was in a little inner division or recess the whole had a slovenly 
confined and sleepy look like a cage for a human dormouse while he 
looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window looked
like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up as indeed he was 
 i never saw this room before i remarked but there used to be no
porter here 
 no said he not till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convicts and
tag and rag and bobtail going up and down and then i was recommended to
the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought and
i took it it s easier than bellowsing and hammering that s loaded 
that is 
my eye had been caught by a gun with a brass bound stock over the
chimney piece and his eye had followed mine 
 well said i not desirous of more conversation shall i go up to
miss havisham 
 burn me if i know he retorted first stretching himself and then
shaking himself my orders ends here young master i give this here
bell a rap with this here hammer and you go on along the passage till
you meet somebody 
 i am expected i believe 
 burn me twice over if i can say said he 
upon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in
my thick boots and he made his bell sound at the end of the passage 
while the bell was still reverberating i found sarah pocket who
appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason
of me 
 oh said she you is it mr pip 
 it is miss pocket i am glad to tell you that mr pocket and family
are all well 
 are they any wiser said sarah with a dismal shake of the head they
had better be wiser than well ah matthew matthew you know your way 
sir 
tolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time i
ascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old
way at the door of miss havisham s room pip s rap i heard her say 
immediately come in pip 
she was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two
hands crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eyes on
the fire sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been
worn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an elegant
lady whom i had never seen 
 come in pip miss havisham continued to mutter without looking round
or up come in pip how do you do pip so you kiss my hand as if i
were a queen eh well 
she looked up at me suddenly only moving her eyes and repeated in a
grimly playful manner 
 well 
 i heard miss havisham said i rather at a loss that you were so
kind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directly 
 well 
the lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eyes and looked
archly at me and then i saw that the eyes were estella s eyes but she
was so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly 
in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance 
that i seemed to have made none i fancied as i looked at her that
i slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again o
the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the
inaccessibility that came about her 
she gave me her hand i stammered something about the pleasure i felt in
seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a long 
long time 
 do you find her much changed pip asked miss havisham with her
greedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between
them as a sign to me to sit down there 
 when i came in miss havisham i thought there was nothing of estella
in the face or figure but now it all settles down so curiously into the
old 
 what you are not going to say into the old estella miss havisham
interrupted she was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away
from her don t you remember 
i said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better
then and the like estella smiled with perfect composure and said she
had no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very
disagreeable 
 is he changed miss havisham asked her 
 very much said estella looking at me 
 less coarse and common said miss havisham playing with estella s
hair 
estella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again 
and looked at me and put the shoe down she treated me as a boy still 
but she lured me on 
we sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had
so wrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from
france and that she was going to london proud and wilful as of old 
she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that
it was impossible and out of nature or i thought so to separate them
from her beauty truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence
from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had
disturbed my boyhood from all those ill regulated aspirations that had
first made me ashamed of home and joe from all those visions that had
raised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the
anvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden
window of the forge and flit away in a word it was impossible for me
to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life
of my life 
it was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and
return to the hotel at night and to london to morrow when we had
conversed for a while miss havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden on our coming in by and by she said i should wheel
her about a little as in times of yore 
so estella and i went out into the garden by the gate through which i
had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman now herbert 
i trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress she 
quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine as we
drew near to the place of encounter she stopped and said 
 i must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight
that day but i did and i enjoyed it very much 
 you rewarded me very much 
 did i she replied in an incidental and forgetful way i remember i
entertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill
that he should be brought here to pester me with his company 
 he and i are great friends now 
 are you i think i recollect though that you read with his father 
 yes 
i made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish
look and she already treated me more than enough like a boy 
 since your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your
companions said estella 
 naturally said i 
 and necessarily she added in a haughty tone what was fit company
for you once would be quite unfit company for you now 
in my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering
intention left of going to see joe but if i had this observation put
it to flight 
 you had no idea of your impending good fortune in those times said
estella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting
times 
 not the least 
the air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my
side and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at
hers made a contrast that i strongly felt it would have rankled in me
more than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being
so set apart for her and assigned to her 
the garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and
after we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again
into the brewery yard i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her
walking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and
careless look in that direction did i i reminded her where she had
come out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said i
don t remember not remember that you made me cry said i no said
she and shook her head and looked about her i verily believe that
her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry again 
inwardly and that is the sharpest crying of all 
 you must know said estella condescending to me as a brilliant and
beautiful woman might that i have no heart if that has anything to
do with my memory 
i got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of
doubting that that i knew better that there could be no such beauty
without it 
 oh i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in i have no doubt said
estella and of course if it ceased to beat i should cease
to be but you know what i mean i have no softness there 
no sympathy sentiment nonsense 
what was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and
looked attentively at me anything that i had seen in miss havisham no 
in some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
to miss havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by
children from grown person with whom they have been much associated and
secluded and which when childhood is passed will produce a remarkable
occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite
different and yet i could not trace this to miss havisham i looked
again and though she was still looking at me the suggestion was gone 
what was it 
 i am serious said estella not so much with a frown for her brow was
smooth as with a darkening of her face if we are to be thrown much
together you had better believe it at once no imperiously stopping
me as i opened my lips i have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere i
have never had any such thing 
in another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she
pointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same
first day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to have
seen me standing scared below as my eyes followed her white hand again
the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed me my
involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm instantly
the ghost passed once more and was gone 
what was it 
 what is the matter asked estella are you scared again 
 i should be if i believed what you said just now i replied to turn
it off 
 then you don t very well it is said at any rate miss havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be
laid aside now with other old belongings let us make one more round
of the garden and then go in come you shall not shed tears for my
cruelty to day you shall be my page and give me your shoulder 
her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground she held it in one hand
now and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked we
walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in
bloom for me if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of
the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it could
not have been more cherished in my remembrance 
there was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me 
we were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more
in her case than in mine but the air of inaccessibility which her
beauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my delight 
and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness had chosen
us for one another wretched boy 
at last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise 
that my guardian had come down to see miss havisham on business and
would come back to dinner the old wintry branches of chandeliers in
the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we
were out and miss havisham was in her chair and waiting for me 
it was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began
the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast but 
in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the
chair fixing its eyes upon her estella looked more bright and beautiful
than before and i was under stronger enchantment 
the time so melted away that our early dinner hour drew close at hand 
and estella left us to prepare herself we had stopped near the centre
of the long table and miss havisham with one of her withered arms
stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth as estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the
door miss havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful 
then estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and
said in a whisper 
 is she beautiful graceful well grown do you admire her 
 everybody must who sees her miss havisham 
she drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as
she sat in the chair love her love her love her how does she use
you 
before i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question
at all she repeated love her love her love her if she favors
you love her if she wounds you love her if she tears your heart to
pieces and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper love
her love her love her 
never had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her
utterance of these words i could feel the muscles of the thin arm round
my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her 
 hear me pip i adopted her to be loved i bred her and educated her 
to be loved i developed her into what she is that she might be loved 
love her 
she said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she
meant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of
love despair revenge dire death it could not have sounded from her
lips more like a curse 
 i ll tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what
real love is it is blind devotion unquestioning self humiliation 
utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the
whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter as i
did 
when she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught
her round the waist for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a
dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself
against the wall and fallen dead 
all this passed in a few seconds as i drew her down into her chair i
was conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in
the room 
he always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a
pocket handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was
of great value to him in his profession i have seen him so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket handkerchief
as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing 
as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client
or witness committed himself that the self committal has followed
directly quite as a matter of course when i saw him in the room he had
this expressive pocket handkerchief in both hands and was looking at
us on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause
in that attitude indeed singular and then put the handkerchief to
its right use with wonderful effect 
miss havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody
else afraid of him she made a strong attempt to compose herself and
stammered that he was as punctual as ever 
 as punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us how do you do 
pip shall i give you a ride miss havisham once round and so you are
here pip 
i told him when i had arrived and how miss havisham had wished me to
come and see estella to which he replied ah very fine young lady 
then he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him with one of his
large hands and put the other in his trousers pocket as if the pocket
were full of secrets 
 well pip how often have you seen miss estella before said he when
he came to a stop 
 how often 
 ah how many times ten thousand times 
 oh certainly not so many 
 twice 
 jaggers interposed miss havisham much to my relief leave my pip
alone and go with him to your dinner 
he complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together while
we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved
yard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss havisham eat
and drink offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred
times and once 
i considered and said never 
 and never will pip he retorted with a frowning smile she has
never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this
present life of hers she wanders about in the night and then lays
hands on such food as she takes 
 pray sir said i may i ask you a question 
 you may said he and i may decline to answer it put your question 
 estella s name is it havisham or i had nothing to add 
 or what said he 
 is it havisham 
 it is havisham 
this brought us to the dinner table where she and sarah pocket awaited
us mr jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my
green and yellow friend we dined very well and were waited on by a
maid servant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but
who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole
time after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my
guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the
two ladies left us 
anything to equal the determined reticence of mr jaggers under that
roof i never saw elsewhere even in him he kept his very looks to
himself and scarcely directed his eyes to estella s face once during
dinner when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered 
but never looked at her that i could see on the other hand she often
looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his
face never showed the least consciousness throughout dinner he took
a dry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here 
again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he
extorted and even did extort though i don t know how those references
out of my innocent self 
and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him
of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that
really was too much for me he cross examined his very wine when he had
nothing else in hand he held it between himself and the candle tasted
the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his
glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and
cross examined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known
the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage three or four
times i feebly thought i would start conversation but whenever he saw
me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his
hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to
take notice that it was of no use for he couldn t answer 
i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her
in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her
cap which was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mop and
strewing the ground with her hair which assuredly had never grown
on her head she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss
havisham s room and we four played at whist in the interval miss
havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels
from her dressing table into estella s hair and about her bosom and
arms and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick
eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him 
with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it 
of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and
came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the
glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing nor of
the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the
light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long
ago what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold
presence and my feelings towards estella it was not that i knew i could
never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to
hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see
him wash his hands of her it was that my admiration should be within
a foot or two of him it was that my feelings should be in the same
place with him that was the agonizing circumstance 
we played until nine o clock and then it was arranged that when estella
came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her
at the coach and then i took leave of her and touched her and left
her 
my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine far into the
night miss havisham s words love her love her love her sounded in
my ears i adapted them for my own repetition and said to my pillow i
love her i love her i love her hundreds of times then a burst of
gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the
blacksmith s boy then i thought if she were as i feared by no means
rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she begin to be
interested in me when should i awaken the heart within her that was
mute and sleeping now 
ah me i thought those were high and great emotions but i never thought
there was anything low and small in my keeping away from joe because
i knew she would be contemptuous of him it was but a day gone and joe
had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried god forgive me 
soon dried 
after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar
in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlick s
being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havisham s 
 why of course he is not the right sort of man pip said my guardian 
comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man
who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man it seemed
quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was
not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a
satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick very
good pip he observed when i had concluded i ll go round presently 
and pay our friend off rather alarmed by this summary action i was
for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be
difficult to deal with oh no he won t said my guardian making his
pocket handkerchief point with perfect confidence i should like to
see him argue the question with me 
as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i
breakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely hold
my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and
that i would go on along the london road while mr jaggers was occupied 
if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when
overtaken i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar immediately
after breakfast by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into
the open country at the back of pumblechook s premises i got round into
the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in
comparative security 
it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not
disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after 
one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went
a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they
had forgotten something and pass me face to face on which occasions i
don t know whether they or i made the worse pretence they of not doing
it or i of not seeing it still my position was a distinguished one 
and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the
way of that unlimited miscreant trabb s boy 
casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i
beheld trabb s boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag 
deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best
beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced
with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating
myself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabb s boy smote
together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in
every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace 
 hold me i m so frightened feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance as i passed him 
his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme
humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust 
this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing i had not advanced
another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement 
and indignation i again beheld trabb s boy approaching he was coming
round a narrow corner his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest
industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabb s with
cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait with a shock he became
aware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his
motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees
more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy his
sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators 
and i felt utterly confounded 
i had not got as much further down the street as the post office when i
again beheld trabb s boy shooting round by a back way this time he was
entirely changed he wore the blue bag in the manner of my great coat 
and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of
the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he
from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand don t know yah 
words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon
me by trabb s boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his
shirt collar twined his side hair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked
extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his
attendants don t know yah don t know yah pon my soul don t know
yah the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking
to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an
exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith 
culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to
speak ejected by it into the open country 
but unless i had taken the life of trabb s boy on that occasion i
really do not even now see what i could have done save endure to
have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him than his heart s best blood would have been
futile and degrading moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an
invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew
out again between his captor s legs scornfully yelping i wrote 
however to mr trabb by next day s post to say that mr pip must
decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to
the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing
in every respectable mind 
the coach with mr jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my
box seat again and arrived in london safe but not sound for my heart
was gone as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel
of oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then
went on to barnard s inn 
i found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back 
having despatched the avenger to the coffee house for an addition to the
dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend
and chum as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the
hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to
the keyhole i sent him to the play a better proof of the severity
of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than
the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him
employment so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park
corner to see what o clock it was 
dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to
herbert my dear herbert i have something very particular to tell
you 
 my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your
confidence 
 it concerns myself herbert said i and one other person 
herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side 
and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i
didn t go on 
 herbert said i laying my hand upon his knee i love i
adore estella 
instead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy matter of course
way exactly well 
 well herbert is that all you say well 
 what next i mean said herbert of course i know that 
 how do you know it said i 
 how do i know it handel why from you 
 i never told you 
 told me you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i
have had senses to perceive it you have always adored her ever since
i have known you you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
together told me why you have always told me all day long when you
told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her
the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed 
 very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
light i have never left off adoring her and she has come back a most
beautiful and most elegant creature and i saw her yesterday and if i
adored her before i now doubly adore her 
 lucky for you then handel said herbert that you are picked out for
her and allotted to her without encroaching on forbidden ground we
may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
that fact have you any idea yet of estella s views on the adoration
question 
i shook my head gloomily oh she is thousands of miles away from me 
said i 
 patience my dear handel time enough time enough but you have
something more to say 
 i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet it s no worse to say it
than to think it you call me a lucky fellow of course i am i was a
blacksmith s boy but yesterday i am what shall i say i am to day 
 say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert smiling 
and clapping his hand on the back of mine a good fellow with
impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and
dreaming curiously mixed in him 
i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture
in my character on the whole i by no means recognized the analysis 
but thought it not worth disputing 
 when i ask what i am to call myself to day herbert i went on i
suggest what i have in my thoughts you say i am lucky i know i have
done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised
me that is being very lucky and yet when i think of estella 
 and when don t you you know herbert threw in with his eyes on the
fire which i thought kind and sympathetic of him 
 then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances avoiding forbidden
ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of
one person naming no person all my expectations depend and at the
best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what
they are in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been
there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday 
 now handel herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me
that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our
gift horse s mouth with a magnifying glass likewise it seems to me
that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether
overlook one of the best points of the animal didn t you tell me that
your guardian mr jaggers told you in the beginning that you were
not endowed with expectations only and even if he had not told you
so though that is a very large if i grant could you believe that of
all men in london mr jaggers is the man to hold his present relations
towards you unless he were sure of his ground 
i said i could not deny that this was a strong point i said it people
often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justice as if i wanted to deny it 
 i should think it was a strong point said herbert and i should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you
must bide your guardian s time and he must bide his client s time 
you ll be one and twenty before you know where you are and then perhaps
you ll get some further enlightenment at all events you ll be nearer
getting it for it must come at last 
 what a hopeful disposition you have said i gratefully admiring his
cheery ways 
 i ought to have said herbert for i have not much else i must
acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is
not my own but my father s the only remark i ever heard him make on
your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or mr 
jaggers would not be in it and now before i say anything more about my
father or my father s son and repay confidence with confidence i want
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment positively
repulsive 
 you won t succeed said i 
 o yes i shall said he one two three and now i am in for it 
handel my good fellow though he spoke in this light tone he was
very much in earnest i have been thinking since we have been talking
with our feet on this fender that estella surely cannot be a condition
of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian am
i right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never
referred to her directly or indirectly in any way never even hinted 
for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage
ultimately 
 never 
 now handel i am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes upon my
soul and honor not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from
her i told you i should be disagreeable 
i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh
winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had subdued
me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly
rising and when i laid my hand upon the village finger post smote upon
my heart again there was silence between us for a little while 
 yes but my dear handel herbert went on as if we had been talking 
instead of silent its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very
serious think of her bringing up and think of miss havisham think of
what she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me this may
lead to miserable things 
 i know it herbert said i with my head still turned away but i
can t help it 
 you can t detach yourself 
 no impossible 
 you can t try handel 
 no impossible 
 well said herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had
been asleep and stirring the fire now i ll endeavor to make myself
agreeable again 
so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs
in their places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about 
looked into the hall peeped into the letter box shut the door and
came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left
leg in both arms 
 i was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my
father s son i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father s son
to remark that my father s establishment is not particularly brilliant
in its housekeeping 
 there is always plenty herbert said i to say something encouraging 
 o yes and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest approval 
and so does the marine store shop in the back street gravely handel 
for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as i do i
suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up 
but if ever there was the time is gone may i ask you if you have ever
had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country 
that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most
particularly anxious to be married 
this was such a singular question that i asked him in return is it
so 
 i don t know said herbert that s what i want to know because it
is decidedly the case with us my poor sister charlotte who was next me
and died before she was fourteen was a striking example little jane
is the same in her desire to be matrimonially established you
might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual
contemplation of domestic bliss little alick in a frock has already
made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew and
indeed i think we are all engaged except the baby 
 then you are said i 
 i am said herbert but it s a secret 
i assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favored with
further particulars he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my
weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength 
 may i ask the name i said 
 name of clara said herbert 
 live in london 
 yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting
theme that she is rather below my mother s nonsensical family notions 
her father had to do with the victualling of passenger ships i think he
was a species of purser 
 what is he now said i 
 he s an invalid now replied herbert 
 living on 
 on the first floor said herbert which was not at all what i meant 
for i had intended my question to apply to his means i have never seen
him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known clara 
but i have heard him constantly he makes tremendous rows roars and
pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument in looking at me and
then laughing heartily herbert for the time recovered his usual lively
manner 
 don t you expect to see him said i 
 o yes i constantly expect to see him returned herbert because
i never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the
ceiling but i don t know how long the rafters may hold 
when he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told
me that the moment he began to realize capital it was his intention
to marry this young lady he added as a self evident proposition 
engendering low spirits but you can t marry you know while you re
looking about you 
as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to
realize this same capital sometimes was i put my hands in my pockets 
a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention i opened
it and found it to be the play bill i had received from joe relative
to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown and bless my
heart i involuntarily added aloud it s to night 
this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve
to go to the play so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet
herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable
means and when herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me
by reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had
warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles 
made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of mr 
wopsle and denmark 
on our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country
elevated in two arm chairs on a kitchen table holding a court the
whole of the danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble
boy in the wash leather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer
with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life 
and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white
silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance my gifted
townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could have wished
that his curls and forehead had been more probable 
several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded 
the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled
with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him
to the tomb and to have brought it back the royal phantom also carried
a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance
of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a
tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state
of mortality it was this i conceive which led to the shade s being
advised by the gallery to turn over a recommendation which it took
extremely ill it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that
whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time
and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely
contiguous wall this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively 
the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically
brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her 
her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as
if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another 
and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned
as the kettle drum the noble boy in the ancestral boots was
inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able
seaman a strolling actor a grave digger a clergyman and a person
of the utmost importance at a court fencing match on the authority
of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were
judged this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and even on
his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral
service to the general indignation taking the form of nuts lastly 
ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of
time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried
it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an
iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled now the baby s put
to bed let s have supper which to say the least of it was out of
keeping 
upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
playful effect whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or
state a doubt the public helped him out with it as for example on the
question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes 
and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for
it and quite a debating society arose when he asked what should such
fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged
with loud cries of hear hear when he appeared with his stocking
disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat
fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron 
a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his
leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him 
on his taking the recorders very like a little black flute that had
just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door he was
called upon unanimously for rule britannia when he recommended the
player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and don t you do
it neither you re a deal worse than him and i grieve to add that
peals of laughter greeted mr wopsle on every one of these occasions 
but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance
of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash house
on one side and a turnpike gate on the other mr wopsle in a
comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike 
the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out here s the
undertaker a coming to see how you re a getting on with your work 
i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that mr wopsle
could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it 
without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast 
but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the
comment wai ter the arrival of the body for interment in an empty
black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general
joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of
an individual obnoxious to identification the joy attended mr wopsle
through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and
the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the
kitchen table and had died by inches from the ankles upward 
we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud mr wopsle 
but they were too hopeless to be persisted in therefore we had sat 
feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear i
laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll 
and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
fine in mr wopsle s elocution not for old associations sake i am
afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very up hill and
down hill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything 
when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said
to herbert let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him 
we made all the haste we could down stairs but we were not quick enough
either standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy
smear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we
came up with him 
 mr pip and friend 
identity of mr pip and friend confessed 
 mr waldengarver said the man would be glad to have the honor 
 waldengarver i repeated when herbert murmured in my ear probably
wopsle 
 oh said i yes shall we follow you 
 a few steps please when we were in a side alley he turned and
asked how did you think he looked i dressed him 
i don t know what he had looked like except a funeral with the
addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a
blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some
extraordinary fire office but i said he had looked very nice 
 when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak
beautiful but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he
see the ghost in the queen s apartment he might have made more of his
stockings 
i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door 
into a sort of hot packing case immediately behind it here mr wopsle
was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just
room for us to look at him over one another s shoulders by keeping the
packing case door or lid wide open 
 gentlemen said mr wopsle i am proud to see you i hope mr pip 
you will excuse my sending round i had the happiness to know you in
former times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
acknowledged on the noble and the affluent 
meanwhile mr waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to
get himself out of his princely sables 
 skin the stockings off mr waldengarver said the owner of that
property or you ll bust em bust em and you ll bust five and thirty
shillings shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair keep
quiet in your chair now and leave em to me 
with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who on
the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward
with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow 
i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play but then mr 
waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said 
 gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front 
herbert said from behind at the same time poking me capitally so i
said capitally 
 how did you like my reading of the character gentlemen said mr 
waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage 
herbert said from behind again poking me massive and concrete so i
said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it 
 massive and concrete 
 i am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said mr waldengarver 
with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at
the time and holding on by the seat of the chair 
 but i ll tell you one thing mr waldengarver said the man who was on
his knees in which you re out in your reading now mind i don t care
who says contrairy i tell you so you re out in your reading of hamlet
when you get your legs in profile the last hamlet as i dressed made
the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a
large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which
was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever
his reading brought him into profile i called out i don t see no
wafers and at night his reading was lovely 
mr waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful
dependent i overlook his folly and then said aloud my view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve they
will improve 
herbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve 
 did you observe gentlemen said mr waldengarver that there was a
man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service i
mean the representation 
we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man i
added he was drunk no doubt 
 o dear no sir said mr wopsle not drunk his employer would see to
that sir his employer would not allow him to be drunk 
 you know his employer said i 
mr wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again performing both
ceremonies very slowly you must have observed gentlemen said he 
 an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance
expressive of low malignity who went through i will not say
sustained the r le if i may use a french expression of claudius king
of denmark that is his employer gentlemen such is the profession 
without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for mr 
wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was 
that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces
put on which jostled us out at the doorway to ask herbert what he
thought of having him home to supper herbert said he thought it would
be kind to do so therefore i invited him and he went to barnard s
with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat
until two o clock in the morning reviewing his success and developing
his plans i forget in detail what they were but i have a general
recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end
with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft
and without a chance or hope 
miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella and
miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i
had to give my hand in marriage to herbert s clara or play hamlet to
miss havisham s ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing
twenty words of it 
one day when i was busy with my books and mr pocket i received a note
by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter 
for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed 
i divined whose hand it was it had no set beginning as dear mr pip 
or dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus 
 i am to come to london the day after to morrow by the midday coach i
believe it was settled you should meet me at all events miss havisham
has that impression and i write in obedience to it she sends you her
regard 
 yours estella 
if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits
of clothes for this occasion but as there was not i was fain to be
content with those i had my appetite vanished instantly and i knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived not that its arrival brought
me either for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the
coach office in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the
blue boar in our town for all that i knew this perfectly well i still
felt as if it were not safe to let the coach office be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason i
had performed the first half hour of a watch of four or five hours when
wemmick ran against me 
 halloa mr pip said he how do you do i should hardly have thought
this was your beat 
i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged 
 both flourishing thankye said wemmick and particularly the aged 
he s in wonderful feather he ll be eighty two next birthday i have
a notion of firing eighty two times if the neighborhood shouldn t
complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure 
however this is not london talk where do you think i am going to 
 to the office said i for he was tending in that direction 
 next thing to it returned wemmick i am going to newgate we are in
a banker s parcel case just at present and i have been down the road
taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word
or two with our client 
 did your client commit the robbery i asked 
 bless your soul and body no answered wemmick very drily but he
is accused of it so might you or i be either of us might be accused of
it you know 
 only neither of us is i remarked 
 yah said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger 
 you re a deep one mr pip would you like to have a look at newgate 
have you time to spare 
i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief 
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my
eye on the coach office muttering that i would make the inquiry whether
i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained
from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his
temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected which
i knew beforehand quite as well as he i then rejoined mr wemmick and
affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i
had received accepted his offer 
we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules into the interior of the jail at that time jails were much
neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrongdoing and which is always its heaviest and longest
punishment was still far off so felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup 
it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was going his
rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying
beer and talking to friends and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing
scene it was 
it struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener
might walk among his plants this was first put into my head by his
seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain
tom are you there ah indeed and also is that black bill behind
the cistern why i didn t look for you these two months how do you find
yourself equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to
anxious whisperers always singly wemmick with his post office in
an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were
taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last
observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial 
he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department
of mr jaggers s business though something of the state of mr jaggers
hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits his
personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod 
and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both
hands and then tightening the post office and putting his hands in his
pockets in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the
raising of fees and then mr wemmick backing as far as possible from
the insufficient money produced said it s no use my boy i m only
a subordinate i can t take it don t go on in that way with a
subordinate if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had
better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals
in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may
be worth the while of another that s my recommendation to you speaking
as a subordinate don t try on useless measures why should you now 
who s next 
thus we walked through wemmick s greenhouse until he turned to me and
said notice the man i shall shake hands with i should have done so 
without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet 
almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can
see now as i write in a well worn olive colored frock coat with a
peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that
went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner
of the bars and put his hand to his hat which had a greasy and fatty
surface like cold broth with a half serious and half jocose military
salute 
 colonel to you said wemmick how are you colonel 
 all right mr wemmick 
 everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong
for us colonel 
 yes it was too strong sir but i don t care 
 no no said wemmick coolly you don t care then turning to me 
 served his majesty this man was a soldier in the line and bought his
discharge 
i said indeed and the man s eyes looked at me and then looked over
my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across
his lips and laughed 
 i think i shall be out of this on monday sir he said to wemmick 
 perhaps returned my friend but there s no knowing 
 i am glad to have the chance of bidding you good by mr wemmick said
the man stretching out his hand between two bars 
 thankye said wemmick shaking hands with him same to you colonel 
 if what i had upon me when taken had been real mr wemmick said the
man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favor of
your wearing another ring in acknowledgment of your attentions 
 i ll accept the will for the deed said wemmick by the by you were
quite a pigeon fancier the man looked up at the sky i am told you
had a remarkable breed of tumblers could you commission any friend of
yours to bring me a pair of you ve no further use for em 
 it shall be done sir 
 all right said wemmick they shall be taken care of good afternoon 
colonel good by they shook hands again and as we walked away wemmick
said to me a coiner a very good workman the recorder s report is
made to day and he is sure to be executed on monday still you see as
far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same 
with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast
his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering
what other pot would go best in its place 
as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great
importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less
than by those whom they held in charge well mr wemmick said the
turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates 
and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other what s mr 
jaggers going to do with that water side murder is he going to make it
manslaughter or what s he going to make of it 
 why don t you ask him returned wemmick 
 o yes i dare say said the turnkey 
 now that s the way with them here mr pip remarked wemmick turning
to me with his post office elongated they don t mind what they ask of
me the subordinate but you ll never catch em asking any questions of
my principal 
 is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your
office asked the turnkey with a grin at mr wemmick s humor 
 there he goes again you see cried wemmick i told you so asks
another question of the subordinate before his first is dry well 
supposing mr pip is one of them 
 why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what mr jaggers
is 
 yah cried wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious
way you re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my
principal you know you are let us out you old fox or i ll get him to
bring an action against you for false imprisonment 
the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over
the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street 
 mind you mr pip said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm
to be more confidential i don t know that mr jaggers does a better
thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high he s always so
high his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities that
colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst ask him
his intentions respecting a case then between his height and them he
slips in his subordinate don t you see and so he has em soul and
body 
i was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardian s
subtlety to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the
first time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities 
mr wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where
suppliants for mr jaggers s notice were lingering about as usual and i
returned to my watch in the street of the coach office with some three
hours on hand i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it
was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime 
that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening i
should have first encountered it that it should have reappeared on two
occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that 
it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement while my
mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young estella proud
and refined coming towards me and i thought with absolute abhorrence
of the contrast between the jail and her i wished that wemmick had not
met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone with him so that 
of all days in the year on this day i might not have had newgate in
my breath and on my clothes i beat the prison dust off my feet as i
sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled
its air from my lungs so contaminated did i feel remembering who was
coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free
from the soiling consciousness of mr wemmick s conservatory when i saw
her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me 
what was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed 
in her furred travelling dress estella seemed more delicately beautiful
than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes her manner was more
winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i
saw miss havisham s influence in the change 
we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and
when it was all collected i remembered having forgotten everything but
herself in the meanwhile that i knew nothing of her destination 
 i am going to richmond she told me our lesson is that there are
two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the
surrey richmond the distance is ten miles i am to have a carriage and
you are to take me this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out
of it o you must take the purse we have no choice you and i but to
obey our instructions we are not free to follow our own devices you
and i 
as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an
inner meaning in her words she said them slightingly but not with
displeasure 
 a carriage will have to be sent for estella will you rest here a
little 
 yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you
are to take care of me the while 
she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a
waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
such a thing in his life to show us a private sitting room upon that 
he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clew without which he
couldn t find the way up stairs and led us to the black hole of the
establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous
article considering the hole s proportions an anchovy sauce cruet 
and somebody s pattens on my objecting to this retreat he took us into
another room with a dinner table for thirty and in the grate a scorched
leaf of a copy book under a bushel of coal dust having looked at this
extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order which 
proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room
in a very low state of mind 
i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong
combination of stable with soup stock might have led one to infer that
the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising
proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department 
yet the room was all in all to me estella being in it i thought that
with her i could have been happy there for life i was not at all happy
there at the time observe and i knew it well 
 where are you going to at richmond i asked estella 
 i am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there 
who has the power or says she has of taking me about and introducing
me and showing people to me and showing me to people 
 i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration 
 yes i suppose so 
she answered so carelessly that i said you speak of yourself as if
you were some one else 
 where did you learn how i speak of others come come said estella 
smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to you i
must talk in my own way how do you thrive with mr pocket 
 i live quite pleasantly there at least it appeared to me that i was
losing a chance 
 at least repeated estella 
 as pleasantly as i could anywhere away from you 
 you silly boy said estella quite composedly how can you talk such
nonsense your friend mr matthew i believe is superior to the rest of
his family 
 very superior indeed he is nobody s enemy don t add but his
own interposed estella for i hate that class of man but he really
is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite i have heard 
 i am sure i have every reason to say so 
 you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said
estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying for they beset miss havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage they watch you misrepresent you 
write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment
and the occupation of their lives you can scarcely realize to yourself
the hatred those people feel for you 
 they do me no harm i hope 
instead of answering estella burst out laughing this was very singular
to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity when she left
off and she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoyment i said 
in my diffident way with her 
 i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
harm 
 no no you may be sure of that said estella you may be certain that
i laugh because they fail o those people with miss havisham and the
tortures they undergo she laughed again and even now when she had
told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not
doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion 
i thought there must really be something more here than i knew she saw
the thought in my mind and answered it 
 it is not easy for even you said estella to know what satisfaction
it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of
the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous for you were not
brought up in that strange house from a mere baby i was you had not
your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed
and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that
is soft and soothing i had you did not gradually open your round
childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up
in the night i did 
it was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these
remembrances from any shallow place i would not have been the cause of
that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap 
 two things i can tell you said estella first notwithstanding the
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set
your mind at rest that these people never will never would in hundred
years impair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great
or small second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it 
as she gave it to me playfully for her darker mood had been but
momentary i held it and put it to my lips you ridiculous boy said
estella will you never take warning or do you kiss my hand in the
same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek 
 what spirit was that said i 
 i must think a moment a spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters 
 if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again 
 you should have asked before you touched the hand but yes if you
like 
i leaned down and her calm face was like a statue s now said
estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take
care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond 
her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon
us and we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain whatever her tone with me happened to be 
i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet i went on
against trust and against hope why repeat it a thousand times so it
always was 
i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clew 
brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of
tea not a glimpse a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and
forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover 
moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of
parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of
the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and
ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with 
expressing in his countenance burden and suffering after a prolonged
absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with
a casket of precious appearance containing twigs these i steeped in hot
water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i
don t know what for estella 
the bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten 
and the chambermaid taken into consideration in a word the whole
house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estella s purse
much lightened we got into our post coach and drove away turning into
cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the walls
of which i was so ashamed 
 what place is that estella asked me 
i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it and then
told her as she looked at it and drew in her head again 
murmuring wretches i would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration 
 mr jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else 
 has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
than any man in london 
 he is more in the secrets of every place i think said estella in a
low voice 
 you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose 
 i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since
i can remember but i know him no better now than i did before i could
speak plainly what is your own experience of him do you advance with
him 
 once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very
well 
 are you intimate 
 i have dined with him at his private house 
 i fancy said estella shrinking that must be a curious place 
 it is a curious place 
i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
her but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden
glare of gas it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive
with that inexplicable feeling i had had before and when we were out of
it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in lightning 
so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this
side of it and what on that the great city was almost new to her she
told me for she had never left miss havisham s neighborhood until she
had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in
going and returning i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her
while she remained here to that she emphatically said god forbid and
no more 
it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me 
that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task
had needed pains yet this made me none the happier for even if she had
not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have
felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do
it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush
it and throw it away 
when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where mr matthew
pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i
hoped i should see her sometimes 
 o yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you
are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned 
i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of 
 no there are only two mother and daughter the mother is a lady of
some station though not averse to increasing her income 
 i wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soon 
 it is a part of miss havisham s plans for me pip said estella with
a sigh as if she were tired i am to write to her constantly and see
her regularly and report how i go on i and the jewels for they are
nearly all mine now 
it was the first time she had ever called me by my name of course she
did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up 
we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house
by the green a staid old house where hoops and powder and patches 
embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their
court days many a time some ancient trees before the house were still
cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
stiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of
the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the
silent way of the rest 
a bell with an old voice which i dare say in its time had often said
to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamond hilted
sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire sounded
gravely in the moonlight and two cherry colored maids came fluttering
out to receive estella the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she
gave me her hand and a smile and said good night and was absorbed
likewise and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i
should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy
with her but always miserable 
i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in
with a bad heart ache and i got out with a worse heart ache at our
own door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party
escorted by her little lover and i envied her little lover in spite of
his being subject to flopson 
mr pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on
domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and
servants were considered the very best text books on those themes but
mrs pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of
the baby s having been accommodated with a needle case to keep him quiet
during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards 
of millers and more needles were missing than it could be regarded
as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply
externally or to take as a tonic 
mr pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heart ache of begging him
to accept my confidence but happening to look up at mrs pocket as she
sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign
remedy for baby i thought well no i wouldn t 
as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to
notice their effect upon myself and those around me their influence on
my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible 
but i knew very well that it was not all good i lived in a state of
chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to joe my conscience was not
by any means comfortable about biddy when i woke up in the night like
camilla i used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should
have been happier and better if i had never seen miss havisham s face 
and had risen to manhood content to be partners with joe in the honest
old forge many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the
fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the
kitchen fire at home 
yet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
in its production that is to say supposing i had had no expectations 
and yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my
satisfaction that i should have done much better now concerning the
influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so
i perceived though dimly enough perhaps that it was not beneficial
to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert 
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not
afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace
with anxieties and regrets i was not at all remorseful for having
unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor
arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural
bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them
slumbering but herbert s was a very different case and it often caused
me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his
sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing
the canary breasted avenger at his disposal 
so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began
to contract a quantity of debt i could hardly begin but herbert
must begin too so he soon followed at startop s suggestion we put
ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove 
the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not
that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel
among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs i know that these gratifying social
ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i understood
nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the
society which ran gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling
ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove 
the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was
in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honor of
joining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about
town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
at the street corners occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage
headforemost over the apron and i saw him on one occasion deliver
himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional way like coals 
but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be 
according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age 
in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken
herbert s expenses on myself but herbert was proud and i could make
no such proposal to him so he got into difficulties in every direction 
and continued to look about him when we gradually fell into keeping
late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a
desponding eye at breakfast time that he began to look about him more
hopefully about mid day that he drooped when he came into dinner 
that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after
dinner that he all but realized capital towards midnight and that at
about two o clock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again
as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general
purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune 
i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at
hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by herbert
would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those
seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet but in the general
tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was
a thing to transact itself somehow in the meantime mr pocket grew
grayer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the
hair while mrs pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read
her book of dignities lost her pocket handkerchief told us about her
grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into
bed whenever it attracted her notice 
as i am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing
my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing
the description of our usual manners and customs at barnard s inn 
we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people
could make up their minds to give us we were always more or less
miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition 
there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did to the best of my
belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one 
every morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look
about him i often paid him a visit in the dark back room in which
he consorted with an ink jar a hat peg a coal box a string box an
almanac a desk and stool and a ruler and i do not remember that i
ever saw him do anything else but look about him if we all did what
we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a
republic of the virtues he had nothing else to do poor fellow except
at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloyd s in observance
of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think he never did anything
else in connection with lloyd s that i could find out except come back
again when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively
must find an opening he would go on change at a busy time and walk in
and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled
magnates for says herbert to me coming home to dinner on one
of those special occasions i find the truth to be handel that an
opening won t come to one but one must go to it so i have been 
if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated
one another regularly every morning i detested the chambers beyond
expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the
sight of the avenger s livery which had a more expensive and a
less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
four and twenty hours as we got more and more into debt breakfast
became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at
breakfast time threatened by letter with legal proceedings not
unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery 
i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake
him off his feet so that he was actually in the air like a booted
cupid for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll 
at certain times meaning at uncertain times for they depended on our
humor i would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery 
 my dear herbert we are getting on badly 
 my dear handel herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will
believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence 
 then herbert i would respond let us look into our affairs 
we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
this purpose i always thought this was business this was the way to
confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat and
i know herbert thought so too 
we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might
be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark 
dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and
a goodly show of writing and blotting paper for there was something
very comfortable in having plenty of stationery 
i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a
neat hand the heading memorandum of pip s debts with barnard s inn
and the date very carefully added herbert would also take a sheet of
paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of
herbert s debts 
each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side 
which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half
burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the looking glass and
otherwise damaged the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly 
insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this
edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money in point of
meritorious character the two things seemed about equal 
when we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on 
herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful
manner at the sight of his accumulating figures 
 they are mounting up handel herbert would say upon my life they
are mounting up 
 be firm herbert i would retort plying my own pen with great
assiduity look the thing in the face look into your affairs stare
them out of countenance 
 so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance 
however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would
fall to work again after a time he would give up once more on the plea
that he had not got cobbs s bill or lobbs s or nobbs s as the case
might be 
 then herbert estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it
down 
 what a fellow of resource you are my friend would reply with
admiration really your business powers are very remarkable 
i thought so too i established with myself on these occasions 
the reputation of a first rate man of business prompt decisive 
energetic clear cool headed when i had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off my
self approval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation 
when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly 
docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical
bundle then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not my
administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a
focus for him 
my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving
a margin for example supposing herbert s debts to be one hundred and
sixty four pounds four and twopence i would say leave a margin and
put them down at two hundred or supposing my own to be four times as
much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred i had
the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin but i am bound
to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have been an expensive
device for we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent
of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it
imparted got pretty far on into another margin 
but there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these
examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable
opinion of myself soothed by my exertions my method and herbert s
compliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the
table before me among the stationary and feel like a bank of some sort 
rather than a private individual 
we shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we might
not be interrupted i had fallen into my serene state one evening when
we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on
the ground it s for you handel said herbert going out and coming
back with it and i hope there is nothing the matter this was in
allusion to its heavy black seal and border 
the letter was signed trabb co and its contents were simply that
i was an honored sir and that they begged to inform me that mrs j 
gargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past six
in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on
monday next at three o clock in the afternoon 
it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful the figure of my
sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day that
the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed
unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my
thoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming
towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door 
in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there
was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were
still alive and had been often there 
whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my
sister with much tenderness but i suppose there is a shock of regret
which may exist without much tenderness under its influence and
perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with
a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered
so much and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully
pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity 
having written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him
that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in
the curious state of mind i have glanced at i went down early in the
morning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the
forge 
it was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the times
when i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me 
vividly returned but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
softened even the edge of tickler for now the very breath of the beans
and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would
be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be
softened as they thought of me 
at last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co had
put in a funereal execution and taken possession two dismally absurd
persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black
bandage as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort
to anybody were posted at the front door and in one of them i
recognized a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple
into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication
rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck
with both arms all the children of the village and most of the women 
were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house
and forge and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy 
knocked at the door implying that i was far too much exhausted by
grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself 
another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a
wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlor here mr 
trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves
up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity
of black pins at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting
somebody s hat into black long clothes like an african baby so he held
out his hand for mine but i misled by the action and confused by the
occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection 
poor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where 
as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by trabb when i bent
down and said to him dear joe how are you he said pip old chap 
you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and clasped my hand
and said no more 
biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly
here and there and was very helpful when i had spoken to biddy as
i thought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near joe and
there began to wonder in what part of the house it she my sister was 
the air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet cake i looked
about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one
had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cut up plum cake upon
it and there were cut up oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two
decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used
in all my life one full of port and one of sherry standing at this
table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook in a black cloak
and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself 
and making obsequious movements to catch my attention the moment he
succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said
in a subdued voice may i dear sir and did i then descried mr and
mrs hubble the last named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner 
we were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up
separately by trabb into ridiculous bundles 
 which i meantersay pip joe whispered me as we were being what mr 
trabb called formed in the parlor two and two and it was dreadfully
like a preparation for some grim kind of dance which i meantersay 
sir as i would in preference have carried her to the church myself 
along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts
and arms but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on
such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect 
 pocket handkerchiefs out all cried mr trabb at this point in a
depressed business like voice pocket handkerchiefs out we are ready 
so we all put our pocket handkerchiefs to our faces as if our
noses were bleeding and filed out two and two joe and i biddy and
pumblechook mr and mrs hubble the remains of my poor sister had been
brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking
ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like
a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along 
under the guidance of two keepers the postboy and his comrade 
the neighborhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we
were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and
vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off 
and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage at such times
the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our
emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come here they
are and we were all but cheered in this progress i was much annoyed
by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way
as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing
my cloak my thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of
mr and mrs hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in
being members of so distinguished a procession 
and now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard 
close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this
parish and also georgiana wife of the above and there my sister was
laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the
light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees 
of the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing 
i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even
when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought
nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like
a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a
reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into
large property when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that
he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honor and
to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the
price of her death after that he drank all the rest of the sherry 
and mr hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since
observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another
race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal finally he went
away with mr and mrs hubble to make an evening of it i felt sure 
and to tell the jolly bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes
and my earliest benefactor 
when they were all gone and when trabb and his men but not his boy i
looked for him had crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too 
the house felt wholesomer soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a
cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlor not in the old
kitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his
knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great
restraint upon us but after dinner when i made him take his pipe 
and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down
together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better i
noticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to
make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress in which
the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was 
he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little
room and i was pleased too for i felt that i had done rather a great
thing in making the request when the shadows of evening were closing
in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a
little talk 
 biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad
matters 
 do you mr pip said biddy i should have written if i had thought
that 
 don t suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider
that you ought to have thought that 
 do you mr pip 
she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with
her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again after
looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave up
that point 
 i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear 
 oh i can t do so mr pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still
of quiet conviction i have been speaking to mrs hubble and i am
going to her to morrow i hope we shall be able to take some care of mr 
gargery together until he settles down 
 how are you going to live biddy if you want any mo 
 how am i going to live repeated biddy striking in with a momentary
flush upon her face i ll tell you mr pip i am going to try to get
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here i can be
well recommended by all the neighbors and i hope i can be industrious
and patient and teach myself while i teach others you know mr pip 
pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new
schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after
that time and have had time since then to improve 
 i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstances 
 ah except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy 
it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud well 
i thought i would give up that point too so i walked a little further
with biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes 
 i have not heard the particulars of my sister s death biddy 
 they are very slight poor thing she had been in one of her bad
states though they had got better of late rather than worse for four
days when she came out of it in the evening just at tea time and said
quite plainly joe as she had never said any word for a long while i
ran and fetched in mr gargery from the forge she made signs to me that
she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms
round his neck so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down
on his shoulder quite content and satisfied and so she presently said
 joe again and once pardon and once pip and so she never lifted
her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down
on her own bed because we found she was gone 
biddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were
coming out were blurred in my own sight 
 nothing was ever discovered biddy 
 nothing 
 do you know what is become of orlick 
 i should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the
quarries 
 of course you have seen him then why are you looking at that dark
tree in the lane 
 i saw him there on the night she died 
 that was not the last time either biddy 
 no i have seen him there since we have been walking here it is of
no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running
out you know i would not deceive you he was not there a minute and
he is gone 
it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by
this fellow and i felt inveterate against him i told her so and told
her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of
that country by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she
told me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anything she
didn t say of me she had no need i knew what she meant but ever did
his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a
gentle heart 
 indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i and biddy 
we must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often down
here now i am not going to leave poor joe alone 
biddy said never a single word 
 biddy don t you hear me 
 yes mr pip 
 not to mention your calling me mr pip which appears to me to be in
bad taste biddy what do you mean 
 what do i mean asked biddy timidly 
 biddy said i in a virtuously self asserting manner i must request
to know what you mean by this 
 by this said biddy 
 now don t echo i retorted you used not to echo biddy 
 used not said biddy o mr pip used 
well i rather thought i would give up that point too after another
silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position 
 biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often 
to see joe which you received with a marked silence have the goodness 
biddy to tell me why 
 are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often asked
biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the
stars with a clear and honest eye 
 o dear me said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in
despair this really is a very bad side of human nature don t say any
more if you please biddy this shocks me very much 
for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and
when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her
as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard
and the event of the day as often as i was restless in the night and
that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what
an injury what an injustice biddy had done me 
early in the morning i was to go early in the morning i was out and
looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge there
i stood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of
health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun
of the life in store for him were shining on it 
 good by dear joe no don t wipe it off for god s sake give me your
blackened hand i shall be down soon and often 
 never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip 
biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and
a crust of bread biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting 
 i am not angry but i am hurt 
 no don t be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically let only me be
hurt if i have been ungenerous 
once more the mists were rising as i walked away if they disclosed to
me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy
was quite right all i can say is they were quite right too 
herbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our
debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary
transactions and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing 
and i came of age in fulfilment of herbert s prediction that i should
do so before i knew where i was 
herbert himself had come of age eight months before me as he had
nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a
profound sensation in barnard s inn but we had looked forward to
my one and twentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and
anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
help saying something definite on that occasion 
i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my
birthday was on the day before it i received an official note from
wemmick informing me that mr jaggers would be glad if i would call
upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day this convinced
us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual
flutter when i repaired to my guardian s office a model of punctuality 
in the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and
incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of
tissue paper that i liked the look of but he said nothing respecting
it and motioned me with a nod into my guardian s room it was november 
and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against
the chimney piece with his hands under his coattails 
 well pip said he i must call you mr pip to day congratulations 
mr pip 
we shook hands he was always a remarkably short shaker and i thanked
him 
 take a chair mr pip said my guardian 
as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his
boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when
i had been put upon a tombstone the two ghastly casts on the shelf
were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a
stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation 
 now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the
box i am going to have a word or two with you 
 if you please sir 
 what do you suppose said mr jaggers bending forward to look at the
ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling what
do you suppose you are living at the rate of 
 at the rate of sir 
 at repeated mr jaggers still looking at the ceiling 
 the rate of and then looked all round the room and paused with his
pocket handkerchief in his hand half way to his nose 
i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings reluctantly 
i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question this reply
seemed agreeable to mr jaggers who said i thought so and blew his
nose with an air of satisfaction 
 now i have asked you a question my friend said mr jaggers have
you anything to ask me 
 of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions sir but i remember your prohibition 
 ask one said mr jaggers 
 is my benefactor to be made known to me to day 
 no ask another 
 is that confidence to be imparted to me soon 
 waive that a moment said mr jaggers and ask another 
i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
the inquiry have i anything to receive sir on that mr jaggers
said triumphantly i thought we should come to it and called to
wemmick to give him that piece of paper wemmick appeared handed it in 
and disappeared 
 now mr pip said mr jaggers attend if you please you have been
drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in wemmick s
cash book but you are in debt of course 
 i am afraid i must say yes sir 
 you know you must say yes don t you said mr jaggers 
 yes sir 
 i don t ask you what you owe because you don t know and if you did
know you wouldn t tell me you would say less yes yes my friend 
cried mr jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show
of protesting it s likely enough that you think you wouldn t but
you would you ll excuse me but i know better than you now take this
piece of paper in your hand you have got it very good now unfold it
and tell me what it is 
 this is a bank note said i for five hundred pounds 
 that is a bank note repeated mr jaggers for five hundred pounds 
and a very handsome sum of money too i think you consider it so 
 how could i do otherwise 
 ah but answer the question said mr jaggers 
 undoubtedly 
 you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money now that
handsome sum of money pip is your own it is a present to you on this
day in earnest of your expectations and at the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the
donor of the whole appears that is to say you will now take your money
affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from wemmick
one hundred and twenty five pounds per quarter until you are in
communication with the fountain head and no longer with the mere
agent as i have told you before i am the mere agent i execute my
instructions and i am paid for doing so i think them injudicious but
i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits 
i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
liberality with which i was treated when mr jaggers stopped me i am
not paid pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one and
then gathered up his coat tails as he had gathered up the subject and
stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against
him 
after a pause i hinted 
 there was a question just now mr jaggers which you desired me to
waive for a moment i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again 
 what is it said he 
i might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback
to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new is it
likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountain head
you have spoken of mr jaggers will soon there i delicately
stopped 
 will soon what asked mr jaggers that s no question as it stands 
you know 
 will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise
form of words or summon me anywhere else 
 now here replied mr jaggers fixing me for the first time with
his dark deep set eyes we must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village what did i tell you then pip 
 you told me mr jaggers that it might be years hence when that person
appeared 
 just so said mr jaggers that s my answer 
as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my
strong desire to get something out of him and as i felt that it came
quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i
had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him 
 do you suppose it will still be years hence mr jaggers 
mr jaggers shook his head not in negativing the question but in
altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer
it and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when
my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their
suspended attention and were going to sneeze 
 come said mr jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs
of his warmed hands i ll be plain with you my friend pip that s a
question i must not be asked you ll understand that better when i tell
you it s a question that might compromise me come i ll go a little
further with you i ll say something more 
he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the
calves of his legs in the pause he made 
 when that person discloses said mr jaggers straightening himself 
 you and that person will settle your own affairs when that person
discloses my part in this business will cease and determine when that
person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about
it and that s all i have got to say 
we looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked
thoughtfully at the floor from this last speech i derived the notion
that miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him
into her confidence as to her designing me for estella that he resented
this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to
that scheme and would have nothing to do with it when i raised my eyes
again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and
was doing so still 
 if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing
left for me to say 
he nodded assent and pulled out his thief dreaded watch and asked me
where i was going to dine i replied at my own chambers with herbert 
as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favor us with his
company and he promptly accepted the invitation but he insisted on
walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation
for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had
his hands to wash so i said i would go into the outer office and talk
to wemmick 
the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket 
a thought had come into my head which had been often there before 
and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise with
concerning such thought 
he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home 
he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and
stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to
be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his hat and great coat
ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe key as
an athletic exercise after business 
 mr wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion i am very desirous
to serve a friend 
wemmick tightened his post office and shook his head as if his opinion
were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort 
 this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life 
but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning now i want somehow to help him to a beginning 
 with money down said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust 
 with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across
me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home with some money down 
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations 
 mr pip said wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my
fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high
as chelsea reach let s see there s london one southwark two 
blackfriars three waterloo four westminster five vauxhall six 
he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his
safe key on the palm of his hand there s as many as six you see to
choose from 
 i don t understand you said i 
 choose your bridge mr pip returned wemmick and take a walk upon
your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch
of your bridge and you know the end of it serve a friend with it and
you may know the end of it too but it s a less pleasant and profitable
end 
i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after
saying this 
 this is very discouraging said i 
 meant to be so said wemmick 
 then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation 
 that a man should never 
 invest portable property in a friend said wemmick certainly
he should not unless he wants to get rid of the friend and then it
becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid
of him 
 and that said i is your deliberate opinion mr wemmick 
 that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office 
 ah said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole
here but would that be your opinion at walworth 
 mr pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this
office is another much as the aged is one person and mr jaggers is
another they must not be confounded together my walworth sentiments
must be taken at walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office 
 very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at
walworth you may depend upon it 
 mr pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and
personal capacity 
we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardian s
ears to be the sharpest of the sharp as he now appeared in his doorway 
towelling his hands wemmick got on his great coat and stood by to snuff
out the candles we all three went into the street together and from
the door step wemmick turned his way and mr jaggers and i turned ours 
i could not help wishing more than once that evening that mr jaggers
had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or
a somebody to unbend his brows a little it was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twenty first birthday that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
made of it he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
wemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to
dinner and mr jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because 
after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the
fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the
details of it he felt so dejected and guilty 
deeming sunday the best day for taking mr wemmick s walworth
sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
to the castle on arriving before the battlements i found the union
jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of
defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most
pacific manner by the aged 
 my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather
had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word
that he would soon be home from his afternoon s walk he is very regular
in his walks is my son very regular in everything is my son 
i nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and
we went in and sat down by the fireside 
 you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his
chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office i
expect i nodded hah i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at
his business sir i nodded hard yes so they tell me his business
is the law i nodded harder which makes it more surprising in my
son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to
the wine coopering 
curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
reputation of mr jaggers i roared that name at him he threw me into
the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
sprightly manner no to be sure you re right and to this hour i
have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i
had made 
as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making
some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own
calling in life had been the wine coopering by dint of straining that
term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the
chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning
understood 
 no said the old gentleman the warehousing the warehousing first 
over yonder he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he
intended to refer me to liverpool and then in the city of london here 
however having an infirmity for i am hard of hearing sir 
i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment 
 yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he
went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little
made out this elegant and beautiful property but returning to what you
said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i
say is no to be sure you re right 
i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this
imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall
on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
wooden flap with john upon it the old man following my eyes cried
with great triumph my son s come home and we both went out to the
drawbridge 
it was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the
other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with
the greatest ease the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge 
that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had
come across and had presented me to miss skiffins a lady by whom he
was accompanied 
miss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in
the post office branch of the service she might have been some two or
three years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed
of portable property the cut of her dress from the waist upward both
before and behind made her figure very like a boy s kite and i might
have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a
little too intensely green but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow 
and showed a high regard for the aged i was not long in discovering
that she was a frequent visitor at the castle for on our going in 
and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing
himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to
the other side of the chimney and disappeared presently another click
came and another little door tumbled open with miss skiffins on it 
then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open then miss skiffins
and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together on
wemmick s return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed
the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you
know they re both pleasant and useful to the aged and by george sir 
it s a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to
this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss
skiffins and me 
 and mr wemmick made them added miss skiffins with his own hands
out of his own head 
while miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green
gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
company wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property 
and see how the island looked in wintertime thinking that he did this
to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized
the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle 
having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i
had never hinted at it before i informed wemmick that i was anxious in
behalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how
we had fought i glanced at herbert s home and at his character and
at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for 
those uncertain and unpunctual i alluded to the advantages i had
derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i
confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might
have done better without me and my expectations keeping miss havisham
in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility
of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of
his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts 
retaliations or designs for all these reasons i told wemmick 
and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great
affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays
upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmick s experience and
knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my resources to
help herbert to some present income say of a hundred a year to keep
him in good hope and heart and gradually to buy him on to some small
partnership i begged wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help
must always be rendered without herbert s knowledge or suspicion and
that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise i
wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i can t help
confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you but that
is your fault in having ever brought me here 
wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of
start well you know mr pip i must tell you one thing this is
devilish good of you 
 say you ll help me to be good then said i 
 ecod replied wemmick shaking his head that s not my trade 
 nor is this your trading place said i 
 you are right he returned you hit the nail on the head mr pip 
i ll put on my considering cap and i think all you want to do may be
done by degrees skiffins that s her brother is an accountant and
agent i ll look him up and go to work for you 
 i thank you ten thousand times 
 on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in
our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there
are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away 
after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into
the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea the responsible
duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent
old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger
of melting his eyes it was no nominal meal that we were going to make 
but a vigorous reality the aged prepared such a hay stack of buttered
toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron
stand hooked on to the top bar while miss skiffins brewed such a jorum
of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and
repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment 
the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right
moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth
as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep nothing disturbed
the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of
john and miss skiffins which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic
infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used
to it i inferred from the methodical nature of miss skiffins s
arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night and i rather
suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an
undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a
piece of portable property that had been given her by wemmick 
we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was
delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it the aged
especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
tribe just oiled after a short pause of repose miss skiffins in the
absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of
her family on sunday afternoons washed up the tea things in a trifling
lady like amateur manner that compromised none of us then she put on
her gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said now 
aged parent tip us the paper 
wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this
was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite
satisfaction to read the news aloud i won t offer an apology said
wemmick for he isn t capable of many pleasures are you aged p 
 all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself
spoken to 
 only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper 
said wemmick and he ll be as happy as a king we are all attention 
aged one 
 all right john all right returned the cheerful old man so busy and
so pleased that it really was quite charming 
the aged s reading reminded me of the classes at mr wopsle s
great aunt s with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was
always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into
them he required as much watching as a powder mill but wemmick was
equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on 
quite unconscious of his many rescues whenever he looked at us we
all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he
resumed again 
as wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy
corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of mr wemmick s mouth 
powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round
miss skiffins s waist in course of time i saw his hand appear on the
other side of miss skiffins but at that moment miss skiffins neatly
stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were
an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the
table before her miss skiffins s composure while she did this was one
of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and if i could have
thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have
deemed that miss skiffins performed it mechanically 
by and by i noticed wemmick s arm beginning to disappear again and
gradually fading out of view shortly afterwards his mouth began to
widen again after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side
of miss skiffins instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness
of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid
it on the table taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am
justified in stating that during the whole time of the aged s reading 
wemmick s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to
it by miss skiffins 
at last the aged read himself into a light slumber this was the time
for wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a
black bottle with a porcelain topped cork representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect with the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who
was soon awake again miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and
wemmick drank out of one glass of course i knew better than to offer to
see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had best
go first which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having
passed a pleasant evening 
before a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth 
stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter
appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would
be glad if i could come and see him again upon it so i went out
to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by
appointment in the city several times but never held any communication
with him on the subject in or near little britain the upshot was 
that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping broker not long
established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted
capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner 
between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert was the
subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged
for sundry other payments some to fall due at certain dates out of my
income some contingent on my coming into my property miss skiffins s
brother conducted the negotiation wemmick pervaded it throughout but
never appeared in it 
the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the
least suspicion of my hand being in it i never shall forget the radiant
face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty
piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young
merchant s name and of clarriker s having shown an extraordinary
inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at
last day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he
must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the
greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so
happy at length the thing being done and he having that day entered
clarriker s house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a
flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when
i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to
somebody 
a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my
view but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all
the changes it involved i must give one chapter to estella it is not
much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart 
if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to
be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost o
the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
me haunted that house when estella lived there let my body be where it
would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that
house 
the lady with whom estella was placed mrs brandley by name was a
widow with one daughter several years older than estella the mother
looked young and the daughter looked old the mother s complexion was
pink and the daughter s was yellow the mother set up for frivolity 
and the daughter for theology they were in what is called a good
position and visited and were visited by numbers of people little 
if any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but the
understanding was established that they were necessary to her and
that she was necessary to them mrs brandley had been a friend of miss
havisham s before the time of her seclusion 
in mrs brandley s house and out of mrs brandley s house i suffered
every kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me the
nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity
without placing me on terms of favor conduced to my distraction 
she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very
familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant
slight on my devotion to her if i had been her secretary steward 
half brother poor relation if i had been a younger brother of her
appointed husband i could not have seemed to myself further from my
hopes when i was nearest to her the privilege of calling her by her
name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances
an aggravation of my trials and while i think it likely that it almost
maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened
me 
she had admirers without end no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them
without that 
i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used
often to take her and the brandleys on the water there were picnics 
f te days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures 
through which i pursued her and they were all miseries to me i never
had one hour s happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the
four and twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me
unto death 
throughout this part of our intercourse and it lasted as will
presently be seen for what i then thought a long time she habitually
reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
upon us there were other times when she would come to a sudden check in
this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me 
 pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat
apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond will you never
take warning 
 of what 
 of me 
 warning not to be attracted by you do you mean estella 
 do i mean if you don t know what i mean you are blind 
i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the
reason that i always was restrained and this was not the least of my
miseries by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her 
when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham my
dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her bosom 
 at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you
wrote to me to come to you this time 
 that s true said estella with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me 
after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on
to say 
 the time has come round when miss havisham wishes to have me for a day
at satis you are to take me there and bring me back if you will she
would rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid 
for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people can
you take me 
 can i take you estella 
 you can then the day after to morrow if you please you are to pay
all charges out of my purse you hear the condition of your going 
 and must obey said i 
this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others
like it miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen
her handwriting we went down on the next day but one and we found her
in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that
there was no change in satis house 
she was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when
i last saw them together i repeat the word advisedly for there was
something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces 
she hung upon estella s beauty hung upon her words hung upon her
gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at
her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared 
from estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to
pry into my heart and probe its wounds how does she use you pip how
does she use you she asked me again with her witch like eagerness 
even in estella s hearing but when we sat by her flickering fire
at night she was most weird for then keeping estella s hand drawn
through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her 
by dint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular
letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated 
and as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind
mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch
stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a
very spectre 
i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakened i saw in this that
estella was set to wreak miss havisham s revenge on men and that she
was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term i saw
in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me sending her
out to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with
the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers 
and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose i saw in
this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while
the prize was reserved for me i saw in this the reason for my being
staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian s declining to
commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme in a word i
saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there before my eyes 
and always had had her before my eyes and i saw in this the distinct
shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden
from the sun 
the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
the wall they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady
dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed as i looked
round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped
clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and
the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection
thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in
everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and
thrown back to me my thoughts passed into the great room across the
landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in
the falls of the cobwebs from the centre piece in the crawlings of the
spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their
little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and
pausings of the beetles on the floor 
it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
between estella and miss havisham it was the first time i had ever seen
them opposed 
we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham
still had estella s arm drawn through her own and still clutched
estella s hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself 
she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather
endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it 
 what said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired
of me 
 only a little tired of myself replied estella disengaging her arm 
and moving to the great chimney piece where she stood looking down at
the fire 
 speak the truth you ingrate cried miss havisham passionately
striking her stick upon the floor you are tired of me 
estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down
at the fire her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a
self possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was
almost cruel 
 you stock and stone exclaimed miss havisham you cold cold heart 
 what said estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she
leaned against the great chimney piece and only moving her eyes do you
reproach me for being cold you 
 are you not was the fierce retort 
 you should know said estella i am what you have made me take
all the praise take all the blame take all the success take all the
failure in short take me 
 o look at her look at her cried miss havisham bitterly look at
her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared where i
took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its
stabs and where i have lavished years of tenderness upon her 
 at least i was no party to the compact said estella for if i could
walk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do but what
would you have you have been very good to me and i owe everything to
you what would you have 
 love replied the other 
 you have it 
 i have not said miss havisham 
 mother by adoption retorted estella never departing from the easy
grace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never
yielding either to anger or tenderness mother by adoption i have
said that i owe everything to you all i possess is freely yours all
that you have given me is at your command to have again beyond that i
have nothing and if you ask me to give you what you never gave me my
gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities 
 did i never give her love cried miss havisham turning wildly to me 
 did i never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all
times and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me let her call me
mad let her call me mad 
 why should i call you mad returned estella i of all people does
any one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as i
do does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half
as well as i do i who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool
that is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up
into your face when your face was strange and frightened me 
 soon forgotten moaned miss havisham times soon forgotten 
 no not forgotten retorted estella not forgotten but treasured up
in my memory when have you found me false to your teaching when have
you found me unmindful of your lessons when have you found me giving
admission here she touched her bosom with her hand to anything that
you excluded be just to me 
 so proud so proud moaned miss havisham pushing away her gray hair
with both her hands 
 who taught me to be proud returned estella who praised me when i
learnt my lesson 
 so hard so hard moaned miss havisham with her former action 
 who taught me to be hard returned estella who praised me when i
learnt my lesson 
 but to be proud and hard to me miss havisham quite shrieked as she
stretched out her arms estella estella estella to be proud and hard
to me 
estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was
not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at
the fire again 
 i cannot think said estella raising her eyes after a silence why
you should be so unreasonable when i come to see you after a separation 
i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes i have never been
unfaithful to you or your schooling i have never shown any weakness
that i can charge myself with 
 would it be weakness to return my love exclaimed miss havisham but
yes yes she would call it so 
 i begin to think said estella in a musing way after another moment
of calm wonder that i almost understand how this comes about if you
had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of
these rooms and had never let her know that there was such a thing as
the daylight by which she had never once seen your face if you had
done that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the
daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and
angry 
miss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and
swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer 
 or said estella which is a nearer case if you had taught her 
from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might 
that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her
enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had
blighted you and would else blight her if you had done this and then 
for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she
could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry 
miss havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her
face but still made no answer 
 so said estella i must be taken as i have been made the success is
not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me 
miss havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor among
the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn i took advantage of
the moment i had sought one from the first to leave the room after
beseeching estella s attention to her with a movement of my hand when
i left estella was yet standing by the great chimney piece just as she
had stood throughout miss havisham s gray hair was all adrift upon the
ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see 
it was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an
hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about
the ruined garden when i at last took courage to return to the room i
found estella sitting at miss havisham s knee taking up some stitches
in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and
of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals afterwards estella
and i played at cards as of yore only we were skilful now and played
french games and so the evening wore away and i went to bed 
i lay in that separate building across the courtyard it was the first
time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to
come near me a thousand miss havishams haunted me she was on this side
of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the
half opened door of the dressing room in the dressing room in the room
overhead in the room beneath everywhere at last when the night was
slow to creep on towards two o clock i felt that i absolutely could no
longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up 
i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard
into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and
walk there for the relief of my mind but i was no sooner in the passage
than i extinguished my candle for i saw miss havisham going along it
in a ghostly manner making a low cry i followed her at a distance 
and saw her go up the staircase she carried a bare candle in her hand 
which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room 
and was a most unearthly object by its light standing at the bottom
of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feast chamber without
seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across
into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low
cry after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back 
but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed
me where to lay my hands during the whole interval whenever i went to
the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass
above and heard her ceaseless low cry 
before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between
her and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and
there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance nor 
did miss havisham s manner towards estella in anywise change except
that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics 
it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley
drummle s name upon it or i would very gladly 
on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when
good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody s agreeing
with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order 
forasmuch as mr drummle had not yet toasted a lady which according
to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brute s turn to
do that day i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the
decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us 
that might easily be what was my indignant surprise when he called upon
the company to pledge him to estella 
 estella who said i 
 never you mind retorted drummle 
 estella of where said i you are bound to say of where which he
was as a finch 
 of richmond gentlemen said drummle putting me out of the question 
 and a peerless beauty 
much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot i
whispered herbert 
 i know that lady said herbert across the table when the toast had
been honored 
 do you said drummle 
 and so do i i added with a scarlet face 
 do you said drummle o lord 
this was the only retort except glass or crockery that the heavy
creature was capable of making but i became as highly incensed by it
as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place
and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honorable
finch s impudence to come down to that grove we always talked
about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of
expression down to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew
nothing mr drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by
that whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew
where i was to be found 
whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood 
after this was a question on which the finches were divided the debate
upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honorable members
told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where
they were to be found however it was decided at last the grove being
a court of honor that if mr drummle would bring never so slight
a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honor of her
acquaintance mr pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a
finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which next day was
appointed for the production lest our honor should take cold from
delay and next day drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in
estella s hand that she had had the honor of dancing with him several
times this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed
into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the
idea that i was to be found anywhere drummle and i then sat snorting
at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate
contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to
have gone ahead at an amazing rate 
i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me for i cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should
show any favor to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below
the average to the present moment i believe it to have been referable
to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for
her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound 
no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored but
a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of
distress 
it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle
had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it a
little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed
one another every day he held on in a dull persistent way and estella
held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost
flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now
scarcely remembering who he was 
the spider as mr jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait 
however and had the patience of his tribe added to that he had a
blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness 
which sometimes did him good service almost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose so the spider doggedly watching
estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil
himself and drop at the right nick of time 
at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls
at most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties 
this blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration
on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him i took the
next opportunity which was when she was waiting for mrs blandley to
take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go 
i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such
places 
 are you tired estella 
 rather pip 
 you should be 
 say rather i should not be for i have my letter to satis house to
write before i go to sleep 
 recounting to night s triumph said i surely a very poor one 
estella 
 what do you mean i didn t know there had been any 
 estella said i do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is
looking over here at us 
 why should i look at him returned estella with her eyes on me
instead what is there in that fellow in the corner yonder to use
your words that i need look at 
 indeed that is the very question i want to ask you said i for he
has been hovering about you all night 
 moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied estella with a glance
towards him hover about a lighted candle can the candle help it 
 no i returned but cannot the estella help it 
 well said she laughing after a moment perhaps yes anything you
like 
 but estella do hear me speak it makes me wretched that you should
encourage a man so generally despised as drummle you know he is
despised 
 well said she 
 you know he is as ungainly within as without a deficient 
ill tempered lowering stupid fellow 
 well said she 
 you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous
roll of addle headed predecessors now don t you 
 well said she again and each time she said it she opened her lovely
eyes the wider 
to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it
from her and said repeating it with emphasis well then that is why
it makes me wretched 
now if i could have believed that she favored drummle with any idea of
making me me wretched i should have been in better heart about it 
but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the
question that i could believe nothing of the kind 
 pip said estella casting her glance over the room don t be foolish
about its effect on you it may have its effect on others and may be
meant to have it s not worth discussing 
 yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say she
throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the
crowd 
 i can bear it said estella 
 oh don t be so proud estella and so inflexible 
 calls me proud and inflexible in this breath said estella opening
her hands and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a
boor 
 there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have
seen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never
give to me 
 do you want me then said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and
serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you 
 do you deceive and entrap him estella 
 yes and many others all of them but you here is mrs brandley i ll
say no more 
 
and now that i have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my
heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered 
to the event that had impended over me longer yet the event that had
begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held estella 
and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first
distortions from miss havisham s wasting hands 
in the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry the
tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through
the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof 
the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to
the great iron ring all being made ready with much labor and the hour
come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and the sharpened
axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his
hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and rushed away and
the ceiling fell so in my case all the work near and afar that
tended to the end had been accomplished and in an instant the blow was
struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me 
i was three and twenty years of age not another word had i heard to
enlighten me on the subject of my expectations and my twenty third
birthday was a week gone we had left barnard s inn more than a year 
and lived in the temple our chambers were in garden court down by the
river 
mr pocket and i had for some time parted company as to our original
relations though we continued on the best terms notwithstanding my
inability to settle to anything which i hope arose out of the restless
and incomplete tenure on which i held my means i had a taste for
reading and read regularly so many hours a day that matter of
herbert s was still progressing and everything with me was as i have
brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter 
business had taken herbert on a journey to marseilles i was alone and
had a dull sense of being alone dispirited and anxious long hoping
that to morrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed i
sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend 
it was wretched weather stormy and wet stormy and wet and mud mud 
mud deep in all the streets day after day a vast heavy veil had been
driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east
there were an eternity of cloud and wind so furious had been the gusts 
that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs 
and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills
carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast of
shipwreck and death violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages
of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been the
worst of all 
alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time 
and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so
exposed to the river we lived at the top of the last house and the
wind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges
of cannon or breakings of a sea when the rain came with it and dashed
against the windows i thought raising my eyes to them as they
rocked that i might have fancied myself in a storm beaten lighthouse 
occasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could
not bear to go out into such a night and when i set the doors open and
looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out and when
i shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows
 opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of
such wind and rain i saw that the lamps in the court were blown out 
and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering and
that the coal fires in barges on the river were being carried away
before the wind like red hot splashes in the rain 
i read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book
at eleven o clock as i shut it saint paul s and all the many
church clocks in the city some leading some accompanying some
following struck that hour the sound was curiously flawed by the wind 
and i was listening and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it 
when i heard a footstep on the stair 
what nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the
footstep of my dead sister matters not it was past in a moment and i
listened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on 
remembering then that the staircase lights were blown out i took up
my reading lamp and went out to the stair head whoever was below had
stopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet 
 there is some one down there is there not i called out looking
down 
 yes said a voice from the darkness beneath 
 what floor do you want 
 the top mr pip 
 that is my name there is nothing the matter 
 nothing the matter returned the voice and the man came on 
i stood with my lamp held out over the stair rail and he came slowly
within its light it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its
circle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere
instant and then out of it in the instant i had seen a face that was
strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched
and pleased by the sight of me 
moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially
dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea that he had long iron gray
hair that his age was about sixty that he was a muscular man strong
on his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to
weather as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp
included us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was
holding out both his hands to me 
 pray what is your business i asked him 
 my business he repeated pausing ah yes i will explain my
business by your leave 
 do you wish to come in 
 yes he replied i wish to come in master 
i had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the
sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face 
i resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond
to it but i took him into the room i had just left and having set the
lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to explain himself 
he looked about him with the strangest air an air of wondering
pleasure as if he had some part in the things he admired and he
pulled off a rough outer coat and his hat then i saw that his head
was furrowed and bald and that the long iron gray hair grew only on
its sides but i saw nothing that in the least explained him on the
contrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hands to
me 
 what do you mean said i half suspecting him to be mad 
he stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over
his head it s disapinting to a man he said in a coarse broken
voice arter having looked for ard so distant and come so fur but
you re not to blame for that neither on us is to blame for that i ll
speak in half a minute give me half a minute please 
he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his
forehead with his large brown veinous hands i looked at him attentively
then and recoiled a little from him but i did not know him 
 there s no one nigh said he looking over his shoulder is there 
 why do you a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night 
ask that question said i 
 you re a game one he returned shaking his head at me with a
deliberate affection at once most unintelligible and most exasperating 
 i m glad you ve grow d up a game one but don t catch hold of me 
you d be sorry arterwards to have done it 
i relinquished the intention he had detected for i knew him even yet
i could not recall a single feature but i knew him if the wind and
the rain had driven away the intervening years had scattered all the
intervening objects had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood
face to face on such different levels i could not have known my convict
more distinctly than i knew him now as he sat in the chair before the
fire no need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me no need
to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head no
need to hug himself with both his arms and take a shivering turn across
the room looking back at me for recognition i knew him before he gave
me one of those aids though a moment before i had not been conscious
of remotely suspecting his identity 
he came back to where i stood and again held out both his hands 
not knowing what to do for in my astonishment i had lost my
self possession i reluctantly gave him my hands he grasped them
heartily raised them to his lips kissed them and still held them 
 you acted noble my boy said he noble pip and i have never forgot
it 
at a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me i laid
a hand upon his breast and put him away 
 stay said i keep off if you are grateful to me for what i did when
i was a little child i hope you have shown your gratitude by mending
your way of life if you have come here to thank me it was not
necessary still however you have found me out there must be something
good in the feeling that has brought you here and i will not repulse
you but surely you must understand that i 
my attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at
me that the words died away on my tongue 
 you was a saying he observed when we had confronted one another
in silence that surely i must understand what surely must i
understand 
 that i cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long
ago under these different circumstances i am glad to believe you have
repented and recovered yourself i am glad to tell you so i am glad
that thinking i deserve to be thanked you have come to thank me but
our ways are different ways none the less you are wet and you look
weary will you drink something before you go 
he had replaced his neckerchief loosely and had stood keenly observant
of me biting a long end of it i think he answered still with the
end at his mouth and still observant of me that i will drink i thank
you afore i go 
there was a tray ready on a side table i brought it to the table
near the fire and asked him what he would have he touched one of the
bottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum
and water i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look
at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his
neckerchief between his teeth evidently forgotten made my hand very
difficult to master when at last i put the glass to him i saw with
amazement that his eyes were full of tears 
up to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished
him gone but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and felt
a touch of reproach i hope said i hurriedly putting something into
a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table that you will not
think i spoke harshly to you just now i had no intention of doing it 
and i am sorry for it if i did i wish you well and happy 
as i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of his
neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and stretched
out his hand i gave him mine and then he drank and drew his sleeve
across his eyes and forehead 
 how are you living i asked him 
 i ve been a sheep farmer stock breeder other trades besides away in
the new world said he many a thousand mile of stormy water off from
this 
 i hope you have done well 
 i ve done wonderfully well there s others went out alonger me as has
done well too but no man has done nigh as well as me i m famous for
it 
 i am glad to hear it 
 i hope to hear you say so my dear boy 
without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which
they were spoken i turned off to a point that had just come into my
mind 
 have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me i inquired since
he undertook that trust 
 never set eyes upon him i warn t likely to it 
 he came faithfully and he brought me the two one pound notes i was
a poor boy then as you know and to a poor boy they were a little
fortune but like you i have done well since and you must let me pay
them back you can put them to some other poor boy s use i took out my
purse 
he watched me as i laid my purse upon the table and opened it and he
watched me as i separated two one pound notes from its contents they
were clean and new and i spread them out and handed them over to
him still watching me he laid them one upon the other folded them
long wise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped
the ashes into the tray 
 may i make so bold he said then with a smile that was like a frown 
and with a frown that was like a smile as ask you how you have done
well since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes 
 how 
 ah 
he emptied his glass got up and stood at the side of the fire with
his heavy brown hand on the mantel shelf he put a foot up to the bars 
to dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam but he neither
looked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me it was only
now that i began to tremble 
when my lips had parted and had shaped some words that were
without sound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it
distinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property 
 might a mere warmint ask what property said he 
i faltered i don t know 
 might a mere warmint ask whose property said he 
i faltered again i don t know 
 could i make a guess i wonder said the convict at your income
since you come of age as to the first figure now five 
with my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action i rose
out of my chair and stood with my hand upon the back of it looking
wildly at him 
 concerning a guardian he went on there ought to have been some
guardian or such like whiles you was a minor some lawyer maybe as
to the first letter of that lawyer s name now would it be j 
all the truth of my position came flashing on me and its
disappointments dangers disgraces consequences of all kinds rushed
in in such a multitude that i was borne down by them and had to struggle
for every breath i drew 
 put it he resumed as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun
with a j and might be jaggers put it as he had come over sea to
portsmouth and had landed there and had wanted to come on to you 
 however you have found me out you says just now well however did
i find you out why i wrote from portsmouth to a person in london for
particulars of your address that person s name why wemmick 
i could not have spoken one word though it had been to save my life 
i stood with a hand on the chair back and a hand on my breast where
i seemed to be suffocating i stood so looking wildly at him until i
grasped at the chair when the room began to surge and turn he caught
me drew me to the sofa put me up against the cushions and bent on one
knee before me bringing the face that i now well remembered and that i
shuddered at very near to mine 
 yes pip dear boy i ve made a gentleman on you it s me wot has
done it i swore that time sure as ever i earned a guinea that guinea
should go to you i swore arterwards sure as ever i spec lated and got
rich you should get rich i lived rough that you should live smooth 
i worked hard that you should be above work what odds dear boy do i
tell it fur you to feel a obligation not a bit i tell it fur you to
know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in got his head
so high that he could make a gentleman and pip you re him 
the abhorrence in which i held the man the dread i had of him the
repugnance with which i shrank from him could not have been exceeded if
he had been some terrible beast 
 look ee here pip i m your second father you re my son more to me
nor any son i ve put away money only for you to spend when i was a
hired out shepherd in a solitary hut not seeing no faces but faces of
sheep till i half forgot wot men s and women s faces wos like i see
yourn i drops my knife many a time in that hut when i was a eating my
dinner or my supper and i says here s the boy again a looking at
me whiles i eats and drinks i see you there a many times as plain as
ever i see you on them misty marshes lord strike me dead i says each
time and i goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens but
wot if i gets liberty and money i ll make that boy a gentleman and
i done it why look at you dear boy look at these here lodgings
o yourn fit for a lord a lord ah you shall show money with lords for
wagers and beat em 
in his heat and triumph and in his knowledge that i had been nearly
fainting he did not remark on my reception of all this it was the one
grain of relief i had 
 look ee here he went on taking my watch out of my pocket and
turning towards him a ring on my finger while i recoiled from his
touch as if he had been a snake a gold un and a beauty that s a
gentleman s i hope a diamond all set round with rubies that s a
gentleman s i hope look at your linen fine and beautiful look at
your clothes better ain t to be got and your books too turning his
eyes round the room mounting up on their shelves by hundreds and
you read em don t you i see you d been a reading of em when i come
in ha ha ha you shall read em to me dear boy and if they re in
foreign languages wot i don t understand i shall be just as proud as if
i did 
again he took both my hands and put them to his lips while my blood ran
cold within me 
 don t you mind talking pip said he after again drawing his sleeve
over his eyes and forehead as the click came in his throat which i well
remembered and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much
in earnest you can t do better nor keep quiet dear boy you ain t
looked slowly forward to this as i have you wosn t prepared for this as
i wos but didn t you never think it might be me 
 o no no no i returned never never 
 well you see it wos me and single handed never a soul in it but my
own self and mr jaggers 
 was there no one else i asked 
 no said he with a glance of surprise who else should there be 
and dear boy how good looking you have growed there s bright eyes
somewheres eh isn t there bright eyes somewheres wot you love the
thoughts on 
o estella estella 
 they shall be yourn dear boy if money can buy em not that a

game but money shall back you let me finish wot i was a telling you 
dear boy from that there hut and that there hiring out i got money

my liberty and went for myself in every single thing i went for i went

to understand just now i m famous for it it was the money left me and
the gains of the first few year wot i sent home to mr jaggers all for
you when he first come arter you agreeable to my letter 
o that he had never come that he had left me at the forge far from
contented yet by comparison happy 
 and then dear boy it was a recompense to me look ee here to know in
secret that i was making a gentleman the blood horses of them colonists
might fling up the dust over me as i was walking what do i say i says
to myself i m making a better gentleman nor ever you ll be when
one of em says to another he was a convict a few year ago and is a
ignorant common fellow now for all he s lucky what do i say i says
to myself if i ain t a gentleman nor yet ain t got no learning i m
the owner of such all on you owns stock and land which on you owns a
brought up london gentleman this way i kep myself a going and this
way i held steady afore my mind that i would for certain come one day
and see my boy and make myself known to him on his own ground 
he laid his hand on my shoulder i shuddered at the thought that for
anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood 
 it warn t easy pip for me to leave them parts nor yet it warn t
safe but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for
i was determined and my mind firm made up at last i done it dear boy 
i done it 
i tried to collect my thoughts but i was stunned throughout i had
seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him 
even now i could not separate his voice from those voices though those
were loud and his was silent 
 where will you put me he asked presently i must be put somewheres 
dear boy 
 to sleep said i 
 yes and to sleep long and sound he answered for i ve been
sea tossed and sea washed months and months 
 my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent you
must have his room 
 he won t come back to morrow will he 
 no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost
efforts not to morrow 
 because look ee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is
necessary 
 how do you mean caution 
 by g it s death 
 what s death 
 i was sent for life it s death to come back there s been overmuch
coming back of late years and i should of a certainty be hanged if
took 
nothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched me
with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come
to me and i held it there in my keeping if i had loved him instead
of abhorring him if i had been attracted to him by the strongest
admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the
strongest repugnance it could have been no worse on the contrary it
would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally
and tenderly addressed my heart 
my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen
from without and then to close and make fast the doors while i did so 
he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when i saw
him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again it
almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his
leg 
when i had gone into herbert s room and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room in
which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed 
he said yes but asked me for some of my gentleman s linen to put
on in the morning i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my
blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good
night 
i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire
in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go
to bed for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think and it
was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i
was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces 
miss havisham s intentions towards me all a mere dream estella not
designed for me i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a
sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first
smarts i had but sharpest and deepest pain of all it was for the
convict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door 
that i had deserted joe 
i would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to
biddy now for any consideration simply i suppose because my sense of
my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration 
no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have
derived from their simplicity and fidelity but i could never never 
undo what i had done 
in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers twice i could
have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door with
these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had
mysterious warnings of this man s approach that for weeks gone by i
had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like his that these
likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had
drawn nearer that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers
to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word 
and with me 
crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen
him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that i had
heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that
i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild
beast out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a
half formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with
him in the dead of the wild solitary night this dilated until it filled
the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my
dreadful burden 
he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and
lowering in his sleep but he was asleep and quietly too though he had
a pistol lying on the pillow assured of this i softly removed the key
to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down
by the fire gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor 
when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of
my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five 
the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain
intensified the thick black darkness 
this is the end of the second stage of pip s expectations 
it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far
as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought pressing
on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a
distance 
the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
self evident it could not be done and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion true i had no avenger in my service now 
but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an
animated rag bag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret
from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration they both had
weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in
at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that
was their only reliable quality besides larceny not to get up a mystery
with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle
had unexpectedly come from the country 
this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness
for the means of getting a light not stumbling on the means after all 
i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to
come with his lantern now in groping my way down the black staircase i
fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner 
as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded
my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come
quickly telling him of the incident on the way back the wind being as
fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by
rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the
staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there it then
occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my
rooms so lighting my candle at the watchman s and leaving him
standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in
which my dreaded guest lay asleep all was quiet and assuredly no other
man was in those chambers 
it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on
that night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram
at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out yes he said at different times of the
night three one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in
the lane and he had seen them all go home again the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the
night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
up stairs 
 the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back
my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate besides them three
gentlemen that i have named i don t call to mind another since about
eleven o clock when a stranger asked for you 
 my uncle i muttered yes 
 you saw him sir 
 yes oh yes 
 likewise the person with him 
 person with him i repeated 
 i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman the person
stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this
way when he took this way 
 what sort of person 
the watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working
person to the best of his belief he had a dust colored kind of clothes
on under a dark coat the watchman made more light of the matter than i
did and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it 
when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apart as for instance some diner out or diner at home 
who had not gone near this watchman s gate might have strayed to my
staircase and dropped asleep there and my nameless visitor might have
brought some one with him to show him the way still joined they had
an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
few hours had made me 
i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the
morning and fell into a doze before it i seemed to have been dozing a
whole night when the clocks struck six as there was full an hour and
a half between me and daylight i dozed again now waking up uneasily 
with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now making thunder
of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into a profound sleep
from which the daylight woke me with a start 
all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor
could i do so yet i had not the power to attend to it i was greatly
dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way 
as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an
elephant when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning all of a leaden hue when i walked from room to room when i
sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to
appear i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long
i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even
who i was that made it 
at last the old woman and the niece came in the latter with a head
not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom and testified surprise
at sight of me and the fire to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in
the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were
to be modified accordingly then i washed and dressed while they knocked
the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream
or sleep waking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting
for him to come to breakfast 
by and by his door opened and he came out i could not bring myself to
bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight 
 i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the
table by what name to call you i have given out that you are my
uncle 
 that s it dear boy call me uncle 
 you assumed some name i suppose on board ship 
 yes dear boy i took the name of provis 
 do you mean to keep that name 
 why yes dear boy it s as good as another unless you d like
another 
 what is your real name i asked him in a whisper 
 magwitch he answered in the same tone chrisen d abel 
 what were you brought up to be 
 a warmint dear boy 
he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some
profession 
 when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder
whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long
ago 
 yes dear boy 
 when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had
you any one with you 
 with me no dear boy 
 but there was some one there 
 i didn t take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the
ways of the place but i think there was a person too come in alonger
me 
 are you known in london 
 i hope not said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick 
 were you known in london once 
 not over and above dear boy i was in the provinces mostly 
 were you tried in london 
 which time said he with a sharp look 
 the last time 
he nodded first knowed mr jaggers that way jaggers was for me 
it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up
a knife gave it a flourish and with the words and what i done is
worked out and paid for fell to at his breakfast 
he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions
were uncouth noisy and greedy some of his teeth had failed him since
i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth 
and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon
it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog if i had begun with any
appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as
i did repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily
looking at the cloth 
 i m a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology
when he made an end of his meal but i always was if it had been in
my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter
trouble similarly i must have my smoke when i was first hired out as
shepherd t other side the world it s my belief i should ha turned into
a molloncolly mad sheep myself if i hadn t a had my smoke 
as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the
breast of the pea coat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negro head having
filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket
were a drawer then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs 
and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearth rug with
his back to the fire and went through his favorite action of holding
out both his hands for mine 
 and this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed
at his pipe and this is the gentleman what i made the real genuine
one it does me good fur to look at you pip all i stip late is to
stand by and look at you dear boy 
i released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning
slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition what i was
chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his
hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron
gray hair at the sides 
 i mustn t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets 
there mustn t be no mud on his boots my gentleman must have horses 
pip horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant
to ride and drive as well shall colonists have their horses and blood
 uns if you please good lord and not my london gentleman no no 
we ll show em another pair of shoes than that pip won t us 
he took out of his pocket a great thick pocket book bursting with
papers and tossed it on the table 
 there s something worth spending in that there book dear boy it s
yourn all i ve got ain t mine it s yourn don t you be afeerd on it 
there s more where that come from i ve come to the old country fur
to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman that ll be my
pleasure my pleasure ull be fur to see him do it and blast you all 
he wound up looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with
a loud snap blast you every one from the judge in his wig to the
colonist a stirring up the dust i ll show a better gentleman than the
whole kit on you put together 
 stop said i almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike i want to speak
to you i want to know what is to be done i want to know how you are to
be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what projects you
have 
 look ee here pip said he laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly
altered and subdued manner first of all look ee here i forgot myself
half a minute ago what i said was low that s what it was low look ee
here pip look over it i ain t a going to be low 
 first i resumed half groaning what precautions can be taken
against your being recognized and seized 
 no dear boy he said in the same tone as before that don t
go first lowness goes first i ain t took so many year to make a
gentleman not without knowing what s due to him look ee here pip i
was low that s what i was low look over it dear boy 
some sense of the grimly ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh as i
replied i have looked over it in heaven s name don t harp upon it 
 yes but look ee here he persisted dear boy i ain t come so fur 
not fur to be low now go on dear boy you was a saying 
 how are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred 
 well dear boy the danger ain t so great without i was informed
agen the danger ain t so much to signify there s jaggers and there s
wemmick and there s you who else is there to inform 
 is there no chance person who might identify you in the street said
i 
 well he returned there ain t many nor yet i don t intend to
advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of a m come back from
botany bay and years have rolled away and who s to gain by it still 
look ee here pip if the danger had been fifty times as great i should
ha come to see you mind you just the same 
 and how long do you remain 
 how long said he taking his black pipe from his mouth and dropping
his jaw as he stared at me i m not a going back i ve come for good 
 where are you to live said i what is to be done with you where
will you be safe 
 dear boy he returned there s disguising wigs can be bought
for money and there s hair powder and spectacles and black
clothes shorts and what not others has done it safe afore and what
others has done afore others can do agen as to the where and how of
living dear boy give me your own opinions on it 
 you take it smoothly now said i but you were very serious last
night when you swore it was death 
 and so i swear it is death said he putting his pipe back in his
mouth and death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and
it s serious that you should fully understand it to be so what then 
when that s once done here i am to go back now ud be as bad as to
stand ground worse besides pip i m here because i ve meant it by
you years and years as to what i dare i m a old bird now as has
dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and i m not afeerd
to perch upon a scarecrow if there s death hid inside of it there is 
and let him come out and i ll face him and then i ll believe in him
and not afore and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen 
once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while 
it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some
quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert
returned whom i expected in two or three days that the secret must
be confided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i
could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with
him out of the question was plain to me but it was by no means so
plain to mr provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved
his consent to herbert s participation until he should have seen him
and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy and even then dear
boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of
his pocket we ll have him on his oath 
to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to
state what i never quite established but this i can say that i never
knew him put it to any other use the book itself had the appearance of
having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge
of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave
him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm on this
first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear
fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself
last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude 
as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he
looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next
discussed with him what dress he should wear he cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had
in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him something between a dean and a dentist it was with considerable
difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a
prosperous farmer s and we arranged that he should cut his hair close 
and wear a little powder lastly as he had not yet been seen by the
laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until
his change of dress was made 
it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my
dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon he was to
remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account
to open the door 
there being to my knowledge a respectable lodging house in essex street 
the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of
my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate
as to secure the second floor for my uncle mr provis i then went from
shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in
his appearance this business transacted i turned my face on my own
account to little britain mr jaggers was at his desk but seeing me
enter got up immediately and stood before his fire 
 now pip said he be careful 
 i will sir i returned for coming along i had thought well of what
i was going to say 
 don t commit yourself said mr jaggers and don t commit any one 
you understand any one don t tell me anything i don t want to know
anything i am not curious 
of course i saw that he knew the man was come 
 i merely want mr jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have
been told is true i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i
may verify it 
mr jaggers nodded but did you say told or informed he asked
me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in
a listening way at the floor told would seem to imply verbal
communication you can t have verbal communication with a man in new
south wales you know 
 i will say informed mr jaggers 
 good 
 i have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the
benefactor so long unknown to me 
 that is the man said mr jaggers in new south wales 
 and only he said i 
 and only he said mr jaggers 
 i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions but i always supposed it was miss
havisham 
 as you say pip returned mr jaggers turning his eyes upon
me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all
responsible for that 
 and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart 
 not a particle of evidence pip said mr jaggers shaking his head
and gathering up his skirts take nothing on its looks take everything
on evidence there s no better rule 
 i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for
a little while i have verified my information and there s an end 
 and magwitch in new south wales having at last disclosed himself 
said mr jaggers you will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout
my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of
fact there has never been the least departure from the strict line of
fact you are quite aware of that 
 quite sir 
 i communicated to magwitch in new south wales when he first wrote to
me from new south wales the caution that he must not expect me ever to
deviate from the strict line of fact i also communicated to him another
caution he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at
some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here i cautioned
him that i must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to
obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural
life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of
felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law i gave
magwitch that caution said mr jaggers looking hard at me i wrote
it to new south wales he guided himself by it no doubt 
 no doubt said i 
 i have been informed by wemmick pursued mr jaggers still looking
hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from
a colonist of the name of purvis or 
 or provis i suggested 
 or provis thank you pip perhaps it is provis perhaps you know it s
provis 
 yes said i 
 you know it s provis a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist
of the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on
behalf of magwitch wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by
return of post probably it is through provis that you have received the
explanation of magwitch in new south wales 
 it came through provis i replied 
 good day pip said mr jaggers offering his hand glad to have
seen you in writing by post to magwitch in new south wales or in
communicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention that
the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you 
together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining good
day pip 
we shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me i
turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two
vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open 
and to force out of their swollen throats o what a man he is 
wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done
nothing for me i went straight back to the temple where i found
the terrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro head in
safety 
next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on 
whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what
he had worn before to my thinking there was something in him that made
it hopeless to attempt to disguise him the more i dressed him and the
better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on
the marshes this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no
doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but i
believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a
weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in
the very grain of the man 
the influences of his solitary hut life were upon him besides and
gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the
influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all 
his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now in all his ways of
sitting and standing and eating and drinking of brooding about in a
high shouldered reluctant style of taking out his great horn handled
jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food of
lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy
pannikins of chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it
the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the
most of an allowance and then drying his finger ends on it and then
swallowing it in these ways and a thousand other small nameless
instances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon 
bondsman plain as plain could be 
it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts but i can compare the
effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was
most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence 
and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head it was
abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short 
words cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful
mystery that he was to me when he fell asleep of an evening with his
knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy chair and his bald head
tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit
and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all
the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to
start up and fly from him every hour so increased my abhorrence of
him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first
agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and
the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon come back 
once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress
myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with
everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier 
i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the
rain always rushing by a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on
my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that
he would be were no small addition to my horrors when he was not
asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of
cards of his own a game that i never saw before or since and in which
he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table when
he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to
read to him foreign language dear boy while i complied he not
comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me
with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the fingers
of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to
the furniture to take notice of my proficiency the imaginary student
pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more
wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling
from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the
fonder he was of me 
this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year it lasted
about five days expecting herbert all the time i dared not go out 
except when i took provis for an airing after dark at length one
evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite
worn out for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
dreams i was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase provis 
who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an
instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand 
 quiet it s herbert i said and herbert came bursting in with the
airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him 
 handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again
how are you i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth why so i must have
been for you have grown quite thin and pale handel my halloa i beg
your pardon 
he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by
seeing provis provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly
putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something
else 
 herbert my dear friend said i shutting the double doors while
herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has
happened this is a visitor of mine 
 it s all right dear boy said provis coming forward with his little
clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert take it in
your right hand lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in
any way sumever kiss it 
 do so as he wishes it i said to herbert so herbert looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis
immediately shaking hands with him said now you re on your oath you
know and never believe me on mine if pip shan t make a gentleman on
you 
in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of herbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i
recounted the whole of the secret enough that i saw my own feelings
reflected in herbert s face and not least among them my repugnance
towards the man who had done so much for me 
what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there
had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story 
saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since
his return on which point he began to hold forth to herbert the
moment my revelation was finished he had no perception of the
possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune his boast that
he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the
character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for
himself and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us 
and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite
established in his own mind 
 though look ee here pip s comrade he said to herbert after having
discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come
back for half a minute i ve been low i said to pip i knowed as i had
been low but don t you fret yourself on that score i ain t made pip a
gentleman and pip ain t a going to make you a gentleman not fur me not
to know what s due to ye both dear boy and pip s comrade you two may
count upon me always having a gen teel muzzle on muzzled i have been
since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am
at the present time muzzled i ever will be 
herbert said certainly but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed we were
anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us
together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat
late it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and
saw him safely in at his own dark door when it closed upon him i
experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of
his arrival 
never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs 
i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in
bringing him back and i looked about me now difficult as it is in a
large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is
conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any
of the people within sight cared about my movements the few who were
passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when i
turned back into the temple nobody had come out at the gate with us 
nobody went in at the gate with me as i crossed by the fountain i saw
his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when i stood for
a few moments in the doorway of the building where i lived before going
up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase
was when i ascended it 
herbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so
blessedly what it is to have a friend when he had spoken some sound
words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the
question what was to be done 
the chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stood for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in
one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with
his pipe and his negro head and his jackknife and his pack of cards 
and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slate i say his
chair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but
next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another he had
no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my
patron neither had i occasion to confess my own we interchanged that
confidence without shaping a syllable 
 what said i to herbert when he was safe in another chair what is
to be done 
 my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned
to think 
 so was i herbert when the blow first fell still something must be
done he is intent upon various new expenses horses and carriages 
and lavish appearances of all kinds he must be stopped somehow 
 you mean that you can t accept 
 how can i i interposed as herbert paused think of him look at
him 
an involuntary shudder passed over both of us 
 yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to
me strongly attached to me was there ever such a fate 
 my poor dear handel herbert repeated 
 then said i after all stopping short here never taking another
penny from him think what i owe him already then again i am heavily
in debt very heavily for me who have now no expectations and i have
been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing 
 well well well herbert remonstrated don t say fit for nothing 
 what am i fit for i know only one thing that i am fit for and that
is to go for a soldier and i might have gone my dear herbert but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection 
of course i broke down there and of course herbert beyond seizing a
warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it 
 anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering won t do if
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors i suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had not very strong that hope if you went soldiering 
besides it s absurd you would be infinitely better in clarriker s
house small as it is i am working up towards a partnership you know 
poor fellow he little suspected with whose money 
 but there is another question said herbert this is an ignorant 
determined man who has long had one fixed idea more than that he
seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce
character 
 i know he is i returned let me tell you what evidence i have seen
of it and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that
encounter with the other convict 
 see then said herbert think of this he comes here at the peril
of his life for the realization of his fixed idea in the moment of
realization after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from
under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him 
do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment 
 i have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night
of his arrival nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his
putting himself in the way of being taken 
 then you may rely upon it said herbert that there would be great
danger of his doing it that is his power over you as long as he remains
in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him 
i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon
me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard
myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my
chair but began pacing to and fro i said to herbert meanwhile that
even if provis were recognized and taken in spite of himself i should
be wretched as the cause however innocently yes even though i was so
wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would
far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i would
ever have come to this 
but there was no staving off the question what was to be done 
 the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him
out of england you will have to go with him and then he may be induced
to go 
 but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back 
 my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street 
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and
making him reckless here than elsewhere if a pretext to get him away
could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his
life now 
 there again said i stopping before herbert with my open hands held
out as if they contained the desperation of the case i know nothing
of his life it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see
him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so
unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days
in my childhood 
herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and
fro together studying the carpet 
 handel said herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take
no further benefits from him do you 
 fully surely you would too if you were in my place 
 and you feel convinced that you must break with him 
 herbert can you ask me 
 and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he
has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from
throwing it away then you must get him out of england before you stir a
finger to extricate yourself that done extricate yourself in heaven s
name and we ll see it out together dear old boy 
it was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again 
with only that done 
 now herbert said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of
his history there is but one way that i know of i must ask him point
blank 
 yes ask him said herbert when we sit at breakfast in the morning 
for he had said on taking leave of herbert that he would come to
breakfast with us 
with this project formed we went to bed i had the wildest dreams
concerning him and woke unrefreshed i woke too to recover the fear
which i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned
transport waking i never lost that fear 
he came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat
down to his meal he was full of plans for his gentleman s coming out
strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon
the pocket book which he had left in my possession he considered the
chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to
look out at once for a fashionable crib near hyde park in which he
could have a shake down when he had made an end of his breakfast 
and was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of
preface 
 after you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that
the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up you
remember 
 remember said he i think so 
 we want to know something about that man and about you it is strange
to know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to
tell last night is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
more 
 well he said after consideration you re on your oath you know 
pip s comrade 
 assuredly replied herbert 
 as to anything i say you know he insisted the oath applies to
all 
 i understand it to do so 
 and look ee here wotever i done is worked out and paid for he
insisted again 
 so be it 
he took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro head 
when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think
it might perplex the thread of his narrative he put it back again 
stuck his pipe in a button hole of his coat spread a hand on each knee 
and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments 
looked round at us and said what follows 
 dear boy and pip s comrade i am not a going fur to tell you my life
like a song or a story book but to give it you short and handy i ll
put it at once into a mouthful of english in jail and out of jail in
jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail there you ve got it 
that s my life pretty much down to such times as i got shipped off 
arter pip stood my friend 
 i ve been done everything to pretty well except hanged i ve been
locked up as much as a silver tea kittle i ve been carted here and
carted there and put out of this town and put out of that town and
stuck in the stocks and whipped and worried and drove i ve no more
notion where i was born than you have if so much i first become aware
of myself down in essex a thieving turnips for my living summun had
run away from me a man a tinker and he d took the fire with him and
left me wery cold 
 i know d my name to be magwitch chrisen d abel how did i know
it much as i know d the birds names in the hedges to be chaffinch 
sparrer thrush i might have thought it was all lies together only as
the birds names come out true i supposed mine did 
 so fur as i could find there warn t a soul that see young abel
magwitch with us little on him as in him but wot caught fright at him 
and either drove him off or took him up i was took up took up took
up to that extent that i reg larly grow d up took up 
 this is the way it was that when i was a ragged little creetur as much
to be pitied as ever i see not that i looked in the glass for there
warn t many insides of furnished houses known to me i got the name of
being hardened this is a terrible hardened one they says to prison
wisitors picking out me may be said to live in jails this boy then
they looked at me and i looked at them and they measured my head some
on em they had better a measured my stomach and others on em giv
me tracts what i couldn t read and made me speeches what i couldn t
understand they always went on agen me about the devil but what
the devil was i to do i must put something into my stomach mustn t
i howsomever i m a getting low and i know what s due dear boy and
pip s comrade don t you be afeerd of me being low 
 tramping begging thieving working sometimes when i could though
that warn t as often as you may think till you put the question whether
you would ha been over ready to give me work yourselves a bit of a
poacher a bit of a laborer a bit of a wagoner a bit of a haymaker 
a bit of a hawker a bit of most things that don t pay and lead to
trouble i got to be a man a deserting soldier in a traveller s rest 
what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs learnt me to read 
and a travelling giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me
to write i warn t locked up as often now as formerly but i wore out my
good share of key metal still 
 at epsom races a matter of over twenty years ago i got acquainted wi 
a man whose skull i d crack wi this poker like the claw of a lobster 
if i d got it on this hob his right name was compeyson and that s the
man dear boy what you see me a pounding in the ditch according to
what you truly told your comrade arter i was gone last night 
 he set up fur a gentleman this compeyson and he d been to a public
boarding school and had learning he was a smooth one to talk and was
a dab at the ways of gentlefolks he was good looking too it was the
night afore the great race when i found him on the heath in a booth
that i know d on him and some more was a sitting among the tables when
i went in and the landlord which had a knowledge of me and was a
sporting one called him out and said i think this is a man that
might suit you meaning i was 
 compeyson he looks at me very noticing and i look at him he has a
watch and a chain and a ring and a breast pin and a handsome suit of
clothes 
 to judge from appearances you re out of luck says compeyson to me 
 yes master and i ve never been in it much i had come out of
kingston jail last on a vagrancy committal not but what it might have
been for something else but it warn t 
 luck changes says compeyson perhaps yours is going to change 
 i says i hope it may be so there s room 
 what can you do says compeyson 
 eat and drink i says if you ll find the materials 
 compeyson laughed looked at me again very noticing giv me five
shillings and appointed me for next night same place 
 i went to compeyson next night same place and compeyson took me on
to be his man and pardner and what was compeyson s business in which we
was to go pardners compeyson s business was the swindling handwriting
forging stolen bank note passing and such like all sorts of traps as
compeyson could set with his head and keep his own legs out of and get
the profits from and let another man in for was compeyson s business 
he d no more heart than a iron file he was as cold as death and he had
the head of the devil afore mentioned 
 there was another in with compeyson as was called arthur not as
being so chrisen d but as a surname he was in a decline and was a
shadow to look at him and compeyson had been in a bad thing with a
rich lady some years afore and they d made a pot of money by it but
compeyson betted and gamed and he d have run through the king s taxes 
so arthur was a dying and a dying poor and with the horrors on him 
and compeyson s wife which compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity
on him when she could and compeyson was a having pity on nothing and
nobody 
 i might a took warning by arthur but i didn t and i won t pretend i
was partick ler for where ud be the good on it dear boy and comrade 
so i begun wi compeyson and a poor tool i was in his hands arthur
lived at the top of compeyson s house over nigh brentford it was and
compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging in case
he should ever get better to work it out but arthur soon settled the
account the second or third time as ever i see him he come a tearing
down into compeyson s parlor late at night in only a flannel gown with
his hair all in a sweat and he says to compeyson s wife sally she
really is upstairs alonger me now and i can t get rid of her she s
all in white he says wi white flowers in her hair and she s awful
mad and she s got a shroud hanging over her arm and she says she ll
put it on me at five in the morning 
 says compeyson why you fool don t you know she s got a living body 
and how should she be up there without coming through the door or in
at the window and up the stairs 
 i don t know how she s there says arthur shivering dreadful with
the horrors but she s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed 
awful mad and over where her heart s broke you broke it there s
drops of blood 
 compeyson spoke hardy but he was always a coward go up alonger this
drivelling sick man he says to his wife and magwitch lend her a
hand will you but he never come nigh himself 
 compeyson s wife and me took him up to bed agen and he raved most
dreadful why look at her he cries out she s a shaking the shroud
at me don t you see her look at her eyes ain t it awful to see her so
mad next he cries she ll put it on me and then i m done for take
it away from her take it away and then he catched hold of us and kep
on a talking to her and answering of her till i half believed i see
her myself 
 compeyson s wife being used to him giv him some liquor to get the
horrors off and by and by he quieted o she s gone has her keeper
been for her he says yes says compeyson s wife did you tell him
to lock her and bar her in yes and to take that ugly thing away
from her yes yes all right you re a good creetur he says 
 don t leave me whatever you do and thank you 
 he rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and
then he starts up with a scream and screams out here she is she s
got the shroud again she s unfolding it she s coming out of the
corner she s coming to the bed hold me both on you one of each
side don t let her touch me with it hah she missed me that time 
don t let her throw it over my shoulders don t let her lift me up to
get it round me she s lifting me up keep me down then he lifted
himself up hard and was dead 
 compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides him and
me was soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own
book this here little black book dear boy what i swore your comrade
on 
 not to go into the things that compeyson planned and i done which ud
take a week i ll simply say to you dear boy and pip s comrade that
that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave i was always
in debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a
getting into danger he was younger than me but he d got craft and
he d got learning and he overmatched me five hundred times told and
no mercy my missis as i had the hard time wi stop though i ain t
brought her in 
he looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in
the book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire and
spread his hands broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them
on again 
 there ain t no need to go into it he said looking round once more 
 the time wi compeyson was a most as hard a time as ever i had that
said all s said did i tell you as i was tried alone for misdemeanor 
while with compeyson 
i answered no 
 well he said i was and got convicted as to took up on suspicion 
that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted 
but evidence was wanting at last me and compeyson was both committed
for felony on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation and
there was other charges behind compeyson says to me separate
defences no communication and that was all and i was so miserable
poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on my back 
afore i could get jaggers 
 when we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman
compeyson looked wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white
pocket handkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked when
the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i
noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him when the
evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had
come for ard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money
had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing
and get the profit but when the defence come on then i see the plan
plainer for says the counsellor for compeyson my lord and gentlemen 
here you has afore you side by side two persons as your eyes can
separate wide one the younger well brought up who will be spoke to
as such one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to as such 
one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here transactions and
only suspected t other the elder always seen in em and always wi his
guilt brought home can you doubt if there is but one in it which is
the one and if there is two in it which is much the worst one and
such like and when it come to character warn t it compeyson as had
been to the school and warn t it his schoolfellows as was in this
position and in that and warn t it him as had been know d by witnesses
in such clubs and societies and nowt to his disadvantage and warn t it
me as had been tried afore and as had been know d up hill and down dale
in bridewells and lock ups and when it come to speech making warn t it
compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then
into his white pocket handkercher ah and wi verses in his speech 
too and warn t it me as could only say gentlemen this man at my
side is a most precious rascal and when the verdict come warn t it
compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and
bad company and giving up all the information he could agen me 
and warn t it me as got never a word but guilty and when i says to
compeyson once out of this court i ll smash that face of yourn 
ain t it compeyson as prays the judge to be protected and gets two
turnkeys stood betwixt us and when we re sentenced ain t it him as
gets seven year and me fourteen and ain t it him as the judge is
sorry for because he might a done so well and ain t it me as the judge
perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion likely to come to
worse 
he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked
it took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching
out his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner i ain t a going
to be low dear boy 
he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his
face and head and neck and hands before he could go on 
 i had said to compeyson that i d smash that face of his and i swore
lord smash mine to do it we was in the same prison ship but i
couldn t get at him for long though i tried at last i come behind him
and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at
him when i was seen and seized the black hole of that ship warn t
a strong one to a judge of black holes that could swim and dive i
escaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there envying
them as was in em and all over when i first see my boy 
he regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent
to me again though i had felt great pity for him 
 by my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them marshes
too upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to get quit
of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore i hunted him down i
smashed his face and now says i as the worst thing i can do caring
nothing for myself i ll drag you back and i d have swum off towing
him by the hair if it had come to that and i d a got him aboard
without the soldiers 
 of course he d much the best of it to the last his character was so
good he had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous
intentions and his punishment was light i was put in irons brought
to trial again and sent for life i didn t stop for life dear boy and
pip s comrade being here 
 he wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took
his tangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his
button hole and slowly filled it and began to smoke 
 is he dead i asked after a silence 
 is who dead dear boy 
 compeyson 
 he hopes i am if he s alive you may be sure with a fierce look i
never heerd no more of him 
herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book he
softly pushed the book over to me as provis stood smoking with his eyes
on the fire and i read in it 
 young havisham s name was arthur compeyson is the man who professed to
be miss havisham s lover 
i shut the book and nodded slightly to herbert and put the book by but
we neither of us said anything and both looked at provis as he stood
smoking by the fire 
why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be
traced to estella why should i loiter on my road to compare the state
of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
before meeting her at the coach office with the state of mind in which
i now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty 
and the returned transport whom i harbored the road would be none the
smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not
be helped nor i extenuated 
a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather 
his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
there if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could
hardly doubt the consequence that compeyson stood in mortal fear of
him neither of the two could know much better than i and that any
such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
informer was scarcely to be imagined 
never had i breathed and never would i breathe or so i resolved a
word of estella to provis but i said to herbert that before i could
go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham this was when we
were left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story i
resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went 
on my presenting myself at mrs brandley s estella s maid was called to
tell that estella had gone into the country where to satis house as
usual not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without
me when was she coming back there was an air of reservation in the
answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid
believed she was only coming back at all for a little while i could
make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make
nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture 
another night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i
always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the
conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came
back from miss havisham s in the mean time herbert and i were to
consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should
devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious
observation or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose
an expedition we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he
would consent we agreed that his remaining many days in his present
hazard was not to be thought of 
next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise
to go down to joe but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe
or his name provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and
herbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken i was to be
absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his
impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to
be begun it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to
herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that
pretence as to make purchases or the like 
having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havisham s i set
off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out
on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and
whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
mist like a beggar when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly
ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand 
to look at the coach but bentley drummle 
as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him it was a very
lame pretence on both sides the lamer because we both went into the
coffee room where he had just finished his breakfast and where i
ordered mine it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very
well knew why he had come there 
pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had
nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of
coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which
it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly
irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire by
degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the
fire and i got up determined to have my share of it i had to put my
hand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire but still pretended not to know him 
 is this a cut said mr drummle 
 oh said i poker in hand it s you is it how do you do i was
wondering who it was who kept the fire off 
with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side
by side with mr drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire 
 you have just come down said mr drummle edging me a little away
with his shoulder 
 yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder 
 beastly place said drummle your part of the country i think 
 yes i assented i am told it s very like your shropshire 
 not in the least like it said drummle 
here mr drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then mr 
drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his 
 have you been here long i asked determined not to yield an inch of
the fire 
 long enough to be tired of it returned drummle pretending to yawn 
but equally determined 
 do you stay here long 
 can t say answered mr drummle do you 
 can t say said i 
i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if mr drummle s
shoulder had claimed another hair s breadth of room i should have
jerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged a
similar claim mr drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box he
whistled a little so did i 
 large tract of marshes about here i believe said drummle 
 yes what of that said i 
mr drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh and
laughed 
 are you amused mr drummle 
 no said he not particularly i am going out for a ride in the
saddle i mean to explore those marshes for amusement out of the way
villages there they tell me curious little public houses and
smithies and that waiter 
 yes sir 
 is that horse of mine ready 
 brought round to the door sir 
 i say look here you sir the lady won t ride to day the weather
won t do 
 very good sir 
 and i don t dine because i m going to dine at the lady s 
 very good sir 
then drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his
great jowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so
exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the
robber in the story book is said to have taken the old lady and seat
him on the fire 
one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief
came neither of us could relinquish the fire there we stood well
squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our
hands behind us not budging an inch the horse was visible outside in
the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummle s
was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both
stood our ground 
 have you been to the grove since said drummle 
 no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was
there 
 was that when we had a difference of opinion 
 yes i replied very shortly 
 come come they let you off easily enough sneered drummle you
shouldn t have lost your temper 
 mr drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that
subject when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that
occasion i don t throw glasses 
 i do said drummle 
after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity i said 
 mr drummle i did not seek this conversation and i don t think it an
agreeable one 
 i am sure it s not said he superciliously over his shoulder i
don t think anything about it 
 and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we
hold no kind of communication in future 
 quite my opinion said drummle and what i should have suggested
myself or done more likely without suggesting but don t lose your
temper haven t you lost enough without that 
 what do you mean sir 
 waiter said drummle by way of answering me 
the waiter reappeared 
 look here you sir you quite understand that the young lady don t ride
to day and that i dine at the young lady s 
 quite so sir 
when the waiter had felt my fast cooling teapot with the palm of his
hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out drummle 
careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket
and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring choking and
boiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without
introducing estella s name which i could not endure to hear him utter 
and therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were
no one present and forced myself to silence how long we might have
remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but
for the incursion of three thriving farmers laid on by the waiter i
think who came into the coffee room unbuttoning their great coats and
rubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we
were obliged to give way 
i saw him through the window seizing his horse s mane and mounting in
his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away i thought
he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his
mouth which he had forgotten a man in a dust colored dress appeared
with what was wanted i could not have said from where whether from
the inn yard or the street or where not and as drummle leaned down
from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his
head towards the coffee room windows the slouching shoulders and ragged
hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of orlick 
too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or
no or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the
journey from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house
that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered 
never to have seen 
in the room where the dressing table stood and where the wax candles
burnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella miss havisham
seated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet 
estella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on they both raised
their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me i derived
that from the look they interchanged 
 and what wind said miss havisham blows you here pip 
though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused 
estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and
then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as
plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i
had discovered my real benefactor 
 miss havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to
estella and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed 
miss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down 
i took the chair by the dressing table which i had often seen her
occupy with all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural
place for me that day 
 what i had to say to estella miss havisham i will say before you 
presently in a few moments it will not surprise you it will not
displease you i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be 
miss havisham continued to look steadily at me i could see in the
action of estella s fingers as they worked that she attended to what i
said but she did not look up 
 i have found out who my patron is it is not a fortunate discovery 
and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune 
anything there are reasons why i must say no more of that it is not my
secret but another s 
as i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to
go on miss havisham repeated it is not your secret but another s 
well 
 when you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i
belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left 
i suppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have
come as a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid
for it 
 ay pip replied miss havisham steadily nodding her head you did 
 and that mr jaggers 
 mr jaggers said miss havisham taking me up in a firm tone had
nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it his being my lawyer and
his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence he holds the same
relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise be that
as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one 
any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no
suppression or evasion so far 
 but when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least
you led me on said i 
 yes she returned again nodding steadily i let you go on 
 was that kind 
 who am i cried miss havisham striking her stick upon the floor
and flashing into wrath so suddenly that estella glanced up at her in
surprise who am i for god s sake that i should be kind 
it was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it i
told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst 
 well well well she said what else 
 i was liberally paid for my old attendance here i said to soothe
her in being apprenticed and i have asked these questions only for
my own information what follows has another and i hope more
disinterested purpose in humoring my mistake miss havisham you
punished practised on perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses
your intention without offence your self seeking relations 
 i did why they would have it so so would you what has been my
history that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you
not to have it so you made your own snares i never made them 
waiting until she was quiet again for this too flashed out of her in
a wild and sudden way i went on 
 i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham 
and have been constantly among them since i went to london i know them
to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself and i should be
false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or
no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you
deeply wrong both mr matthew pocket and his son herbert if you suppose
them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of
anything designing or mean 
 they are your friends said miss havisham 
 they made themselves my friends said i when they supposed me
to have superseded them and when sarah pocket miss georgiana and
mistress camilla were not my friends i think 
this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do
them good with her she looked at me keenly for a little while and then
said quietly 
 what do you want for them 
 only said i that you would not confound them with the others they
may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same
nature 
still looking at me keenly miss havisham repeated 
 what do you want for them 
 i am not so cunning you see i said in answer conscious that i
reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired 
that i do want something miss havisham if you would spare the money
to do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the
nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you
how 
 why must it be done without his knowledge she asked settling her
hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively 
 because said i i began the service myself more than two years ago 
without his knowledge and i don t want to be betrayed why i fail in my
ability to finish it i cannot explain it is a part of the secret which
is another person s and not mine 
she gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire 
after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light
of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by
the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me again at
first vacantly then with a gradually concentrating attention all
this time estella knitted on when miss havisham had fixed her
attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our
dialogue 
 what else 
 estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my
trembling voice you know i love you you know that i have loved you
long and dearly 
she raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers
plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance i
saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me 
 i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake it induced me
to hope that miss havisham meant us for one another while i thought you
could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it but i
must say it now 
preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going 
estella shook her head 
 i know said i in answer to that action i know i have no hope
that i shall ever call you mine estella i am ignorant what may become
of me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go still i love
you i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house 
looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her
head again 
 it would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise
on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these
years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the
gravity of what she did but i think she did not i think that in the
endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estella 
i saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she
sat looking by turns at estella and at me 
 it seems said estella very calmly that there are sentiments 
fancies i don t know how to call them which i am not able to
comprehend when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form
of words but nothing more you address nothing in my breast you touch
nothing there i don t care for what you say at all i have tried to
warn you of this now have i not 
i said in a miserable manner yes 
 yes but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it 
now did you not think so 
 i thought and hoped you could not mean it you so young untried and
beautiful estella surely it is not in nature 
 it is in my nature she returned and then she added with a stress
upon the words it is in the nature formed within me i make a great
difference between you and all other people when i say so much i can do
no more 
 is it not true said i that bentley drummle is in town here and
pursuing you 
 it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference
of utter contempt 
 that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with
you this very day 
she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied 
 quite true 
 you cannot love him estella 
her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily 
 what have i told you do you still think in spite of it that i do not
mean what i say 
 you would never marry him estella 
she looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her
work in her hands then she said why not tell you the truth i am
going to be married to him 
i dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better
than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear
her say those words when i raised my face again there was such a
ghastly look upon miss havisham s that it impressed me even in my
passionate hurry and grief 
 estella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this
fatal step put me aside for ever you have done so i well know but
bestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle miss havisham
gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done
to the many far better men who admire you and to the few who truly
love you among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly 
though he has not loved you as long as i take him and i can bear it
better for your sake 
my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have
been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all
intelligible to her own mind 
 i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to
him the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be
married soon why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by
adoption it is my own act 
 your own act estella to fling yourself away upon a brute 
 on whom should i fling myself away she retorted with a smile 
 should i fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if
people do feel such things that i took nothing to him there it is
done i shall do well enough and so will my husband as to leading
me into what you call this fatal step miss havisham would have had me
wait and not marry yet but i am tired of the life i have led which
has very few charms for me and i am willing enough to change it say no
more we shall never understand each other 
 such a mean brute such a stupid brute i urged in despair 
 don t be afraid of my being a blessing to him said estella i shall
not be that come here is my hand do we part on this you visionary
boy or man 
 o estella i answered as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand do
what i would to restrain them even if i remained in england and could
hold my head up with the rest how could i see you drummle s wife 
 nonsense she returned nonsense this will pass in no time 
 never estella 
 you will get me out of your thoughts in a week 
 out of my thoughts you are part of my existence part of myself you
have been in every line i have ever read since i first came here the
rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then you have been
in every prospect i have ever seen since on the river on the sails of
the ships on the marshes in the clouds in the light in the darkness 
in the wind in the woods in the sea in the streets you have been
the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become
acquainted with the stones of which the strongest london buildings
are made are not more real or more impossible to be displaced by your
hands than your presence and influence have been to me there and
everywhere and will be estella to the last hour of my life you
cannot choose but remain part of my character part of the little good
in me part of the evil but in this separation i associate you only
with the good and i will faithfully hold you to that always for you
must have done me far more good than harm let me feel now what sharp
distress i may o god bless you god forgive you 
in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself i
don t know the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an
inward wound and gushed out i held her hand to my lips some lingering
moments and so i left her but ever afterwards i remembered and soon
afterwards with stronger reason that while estella looked at me merely
with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand
still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
pity and remorse 
all done all gone so much was done and gone that when i went out at
the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when i went
in for a while i hid myself among some lanes and by paths and then
struck off to walk all the way to london for i had by that time come
to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and
see drummle there that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and
be spoken to that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire
myself out 
it was past midnight when i crossed london bridge pursuing the narrow
intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was
close by the river side through whitefriars i was not expected till
to morrow but i had my keys and if herbert were gone to bed could
get to bed myself without disturbing him 
as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the
temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it
ill that the night porter examined me with much attention as he held the
gate a little way open for me to pass in to help his memory i mentioned
my name 
 i was not quite sure sir but i thought so here s a note sir the
messenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my
lantern 
much surprised by the request i took the note it was directed to
philip pip esquire and on the top of the superscription were the
words please read this here i opened it the watchman holding up
his light and read inside in wemmick s writing 
 don t go home 
turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made
the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot
and drove to the hummums in covent garden in those times a bed was
always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain 
letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on
his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his
list it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a
despotic monster of a four post bedstead in it straddling over the
whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace
and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little
washing stand in quite a divinely righteous manner 
as i had asked for a night light the chamberlain had brought me in 
before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those
virtuous days an object like the ghost of a walking cane which
instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be
lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom
of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly
wide awake pattern on the walls when i had got into bed and lay there
footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own
eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus and thus in the
gloom and death of the night we stared at one another 
what a doleful night how anxious how dismal how long there was an
inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as i
looked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what
a number of blue bottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the
market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying
by for next summer this led me to speculate whether any of them ever
tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my face a
disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable
approaches up my back when i had lain awake a little while those
extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
audible the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little
washing stand ticked and one guitar string played occasionally in the
chest of drawers at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired
a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw
written don t go home 
whatever night fancies and night noises crowded on me they never warded
off this don t go home it plaited itself into whatever i thought of 
as a bodily pain would have done not long before i had read in the
newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the
night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been
found in the morning weltering in blood it came into my head that he
must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to
assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door
to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship
of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing but
all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home 
and when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were
questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed
there could be no more room in it for any other theme even when i
thought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when
i recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and
tones and the action of her fingers while she knitted even then i
was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution don t go home 
when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became
a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate imperative mood present
tense do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do
not ye or you go home let not them go home then potentially i may not
and i cannot go home and i might not could not would not and should
not go home until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over
on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again 
i had left directions that i was to be called at seven for it was plain
that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain
that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be
taken it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been
so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me
from my uneasy bed 
the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o clock the little
servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i
passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company 
and so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was
making tea for himself and the aged an open door afforded a perspective
view of the aged in bed 
 halloa mr pip said wemmick you did come home then 
 yes i returned but i didn t go home 
 that s all right said he rubbing his hands i left a note for you
at each of the temple gates on the chance which gate did you come to 
i told him 
 i ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes said wemmick it s a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it because you don t know when it may be put
in i m going to take a liberty with you would you mind toasting this
sausage for the aged p 
i said i should be delighted to do it 
 then you can go about your work mary anne said wemmick to the little
servant which leaves us to ourselves don t you see mr pip he
added winking as she disappeared 
i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the aged s sausage and he
buttered the crumb of the aged s roll 
 now mr pip you know said wemmick you and i understand one
another we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been
engaged in a confidential transaction before to day official sentiments
are one thing we are extra official 
i cordially assented i was so very nervous that i had already lighted
the aged s sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out 
 i accidentally heard yesterday morning said wemmick being in a
certain place where i once took you even between you and me it s as
well not to mention names when avoidable 
 much better not said i i understand you 
 i heard there by chance yesterday morning said wemmick that
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not
unpossessed of portable property i don t know who it may really
be we won t name this person 
 not necessary said i 
 had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations 
and not quite irrespective of the government expense 
in watching his face i made quite a firework of the aged s sausage 
and greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmick s for which i
apologized 
 by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of
thereabouts from which said wemmick conjectures had been raised and
theories formed i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court 
temple had been watched and might be watched again 
 by whom said i 
 i wouldn t go into that said wemmick evasively it might clash with
official responsibilities i heard it as i have in my time heard other
curious things in the same place i don t tell it you on information
received i heard it 
he took the toasting fork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth
the aged s breakfast neatly on a little tray previous to placing it
before him he went into the aged s room with a clean white cloth and
tied the same under the old gentleman s chin and propped him up and
put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air then he
placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right 
ain t you aged p to which the cheerful aged replied all right 
john my boy all right as there seemed to be a tacit understanding
that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be
considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance
of these proceedings 
 this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to
suspect i said to wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the
person to whom you have adverted is it 
wemmick looked very serious i couldn t undertake to say that of my
own knowledge i mean i couldn t undertake to say it was at first but
it either is or it will be or it s in great danger of being 
as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying
as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out
of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him but i told
him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask
him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he
deemed right and sure that his course would be right he paused in his
breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirt sleeves his
notion of in door comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me
once to put my question 
 you have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is
compeyson 
he answered with one other nod 
 is he living 
one other nod 
 is he in london 
he gave me one other nod compressed the post office exceedingly gave
me one last nod and went on with his breakfast 
 now said wemmick questioning being over which he emphasized and
repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i
heard i went to garden court to find you not finding you i went to
clarriker s to find mr herbert 
 and him you found said i with great anxiety 
 and him i found without mentioning any names or going into any
details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody tom 
jack or richard being about the chambers or about the immediate
neighborhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way
while you were out of the way 
 he would be greatly puzzled what to do 
 he was puzzled what to do not the less because i gave him my opinion
that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out
of the way at present mr pip i ll tell you something under existing
circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once
in it don t break cover too soon lie close wait till things slacken 
before you try the open even for foreign air 
i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had
done 
 mr herbert said wemmick after being all of a heap for half an
hour struck out a plan he mentioned to me as a secret that he is
courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden
pa which pa having been in the purser line of life lies a bed in a
bow window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river you
are acquainted with the young lady most probably 
 not personally said i 
the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion
who did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to
present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate
warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of
the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made
her acquaintance when i had begun to advance herbert s prospects by
stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and
his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to
introduce a third person into their interviews and thus although i was
assured that i had risen in clara s esteem and although the young
lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by
herbert i had never seen her however i did not trouble wemmick with
these particulars 
 the house with the bow window said wemmick being by the river side 
down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it
seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to
let mr herbert put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary
tenement for tom jack or richard now i thought very well of it for
three reasons i ll give you that is to say firstly it s altogether
out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets
great and small secondly without going near it yourself you could
always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through mr herbert 
thirdly after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want
to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packet boat there he
is ready 
much comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and
again and begged him to proceed 
 well sir mr herbert threw himself into the business with a will and
by nine o clock last night he housed tom jack or richard whichever
it may be you and i don t want to know quite successfully at the
old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in
fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it now 
another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you 
and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you
must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged 
this diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason i
recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go
home it brings in more confusion and you want confusion 
wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and
began to get his coat on 
 and now mr pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves i
have probably done the most i can do but if i can ever do more from
a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal
capacity i shall be glad to do it here s the address there can be
no harm in your going here to night and seeing for yourself that all is
well with tom jack or richard before you go home which is another
reason for your not going home last night but after you have gone
home don t go back here you are very welcome i am sure mr pip his
hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them and let me
finally impress one important point upon you he laid his hands upon
my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper avail yourself of this
evening to lay hold of his portable property you don t know what may
happen to him don t let anything happen to the portable property 
quite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i
forbore to try 
 time s up said wemmick and i must be off if you had nothing more
pressing to do than to keep here till dark that s what i should advise 
you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly
quiet day with the aged he ll be up presently and a little bit
of you remember the pig 
 of course said i 
 well and a little bit of him that sausage you toasted was his and
he was in all respects a first rater do try him if it is only for old
acquaintance sake good by aged parent in a cheery shout 
 all right john all right my boy piped the old man from within 
i soon fell asleep before wemmick s fire and the aged and i enjoyed one
another s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day 
we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and
i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it
drowsily when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for
toast and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his
glances at the two little doors in the wall that miss skiffins was
expected 
eight o clock had struck before i got into the air that was scented 
not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the long shore
boat builders and mast oar and block makers all that water side
region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to
me and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted
was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to
find it was called mill pond bank chinks s basin and i had no other
guide to chinks s basin than the old green copper rope walk 
it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself
among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces 
what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of ship builders
and ship breakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground 
though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks
and timber how many ropewalks that were not the old green copper after
several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting
it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank it was a
fresh kind of place all circumstances considered where the wind from
the river had room to turn itself round and there were two or three
trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there
was the old green copper ropewalk whose long and narrow vista i could
trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the
ground that looked like superannuated haymaking rakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth 
selecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a
wooden front and three stories of bow window not bay window which is
another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there 
mrs whimple that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly
woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded she was
immediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into
the parlor and shut the door it was an odd sensation to see his very
familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room
and region and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at
the corner cupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the
chimney piece and the colored engravings on the wall representing the
death of captain cook a ship launch and his majesty king george the
third in a state coachman s wig leather breeches and top boots on the
terrace at windsor 
 all is well handel said herbert and he is quite satisfied though
eager to see you my dear girl is with her father and if you ll wait
till she comes down i ll make you known to her and then we ll go up
stairs that s her father 
i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably
expressed the fact in my countenance 
 i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert smiling but i have
never seen him don t you smell rum he is always at it 
 at rum said i 
 yes returned herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his
gout he persists too in keeping all the provisions up stairs in his
room and serving them out he keeps them on shelves over his head and
will weigh them all his room must be like a chandler s shop 
while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and
then died away 
 what else can be the consequence said herbert in explanation if
he will cut the cheese a man with the gout in his right hand and
everywhere else can t expect to get through a double gloucester without
hurting himself 
he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious
roar 
 to have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to mrs whimple 
said herbert for of course people in general won t stand that noise a
curious place handel isn t it 
it was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean 
 mrs whimple said herbert when i told him so is the best of
housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without
her motherly help for clara has no mother of her own handel and no
relation in the world but old gruffandgrim 
 surely that s not his name herbert 
 no no said herbert that s my name for him his name is mr barley 
but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a
girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody
else about her family 
herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he
first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at
an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home
to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the
motherly mrs whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated
with equal kindness and discretion ever since it was understood that
nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by
reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject
more psychological than gout rum and purser s stores 
as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barley s sustained
growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door
opened and a very pretty slight dark eyed girl of twenty or so came
in with a basket in her hand whom herbert tenderly relieved of the
basket and presented blushing as clara she really was a most
charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that
truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service 
 look here said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate
and tender smile after we had talked a little here s poor clara s
supper served out every night here s her allowance of bread and
here s her slice of cheese and here s her rum which i drink this
is mr barley s breakfast for to morrow served out to be cooked two
mutton chops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two
ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper it s
stewed up together and taken hot and it s a nice thing for the gout i
should think 
there was something so natural and winning in clara s resigned way of
looking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out and
something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of
yielding herself to herbert s embracing arm and something so gentle in
her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinks s basin 
and the old green copper ropewalk with old barley growling in the
beam that i would not have undone the engagement between her and
herbert for all the money in the pocket book i had never opened 
i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the
growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard
above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through
the ceiling to come at us upon this clara said to herbert papa wants
me darling and ran away 
 there is an unconscionable old shark for you said herbert what do
you suppose he wants now handel 
 i don t know said i something to drink 
 that s it cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary
merit he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table 
wait a moment and you ll hear clara lift him up to take some there
he goes another roar with a prolonged shake at the end now said
herbert as it was succeeded by silence he s drinking now said
herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more he s down again
on his back 
clara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me up stairs to
see our charge as we passed mr barley s door he was heard hoarsely
muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the
following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite
the reverse 
 ahoy bless your eyes here s old bill barley here s old bill barley 
bless your eyes here s old bill barley on the flat of his back by the
lord lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder 
here s your old bill barley bless your eyes ahoy bless you 
in this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley
would commune with himself by the day and night together often while
it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was
fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river 
in his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and
airy and in which mr barley was less audible than below i found
provis comfortably settled he expressed no alarm and seemed to
feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was
softened indefinably for i could not have said how and could never
afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly 
the opportunity that the day s rest had given me for reflection had
resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting
compeyson for anything i knew his animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own
destruction therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his
fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmick s judgment
and sources of information 
 ay ay dear boy he answered with a grave nod jaggers knows 
 then i have talked with wemmick said i and have come to tell you
what caution he gave me and what advice 
this i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and i told
him how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or
prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that
my chambers had been watched how wemmick had recommended his keeping
close for a time and my keeping away from him and what wemmick had
said about getting him abroad i added that of course when the time
came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might
be safest in wemmick s judgment what was to follow that i did not touch
upon neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my
own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared
peril for my sake as to altering my way of living by enlarging my
expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult
circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse 
he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout his
coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a
venture he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had
very little fear of his safety with such good help 
herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said
that something had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmick s
suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue we are both good
watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the
right time comes no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no
boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance
is worth saving never mind the season don t you think it might be a
good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and
were in the habit of rowing up and down the river you fall into that
habit and then who notices or minds do it twenty or fifty times 
and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty first or
fifty first 
i liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it we agreed
that it should be carried into execution and that provis should never
recognize us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank but
we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his
window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right 
our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go 
remarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and
that i would take half an hour s start of him i don t like to leave
you here i said to provis though i cannot doubt your being safer
here than near me good by 
 dear boy he answered clasping my hands i don t know when we may
meet again and i don t like good by say good night 
 good night herbert will go regularly between us and when the time
comes you may be certain i shall be ready good night good night 
we thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms and we left him
on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stair rail to
light us down stairs looking back at him i thought of the first night
of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little
supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him
as it was now 
old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no
appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease when we got to the
foot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name of
provis he replied certainly not and that the lodger was mr campbell 
he also explained that the utmost known of mr campbell there was 
that he herbert had mr campbell consigned to him and felt a strong
personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded
life so when we went into the parlor where mrs whimple and clara were
seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in mr campbell but
kept it to myself 
when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark eyed girl and of the
motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little
affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper ropewalk had
grown quite a different place old barley might be as old as the hills 
and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming
youth and trust and hope enough in chinks s basin to fill it to
overflowing and then i thought of estella and of our parting and went
home very sadly 
all things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them the
windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark
and still and there was no lounger in garden court i walked past the
fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between
me and my rooms but i was quite alone herbert coming to my
bedside when he came in for i went straight to bed dispirited and
fatigued made the same report opening one of the windows after that 
he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was a
solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour 
next day i set myself to get the boat it was soon done and the boat
was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach
her within a minute or two then i began to go out as for training and
practice sometimes alone sometimes with herbert i was often out in
cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been
out a few times at first i kept above blackfriars bridge but as the
hours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge it was old
london bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there
was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation but i
knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so
began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith 
the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were pulling a
pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards
the east come down herbert was rarely there less frequently than three
times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence
that was at all alarming still i knew that there was cause for alarm 
and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched once received 
it is a haunting idea how many undesigning persons i suspected of
watching me it would be hard to calculate 
in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding 
herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to
think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara but
i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch and that
any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly 
silently and surely to take him 
some weeks passed without bringing any change we waited for wemmick 
and he made no sign if i had never known him out of little britain and
had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the
castle i might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him as i
did 
my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed
for money by more than one creditor even i myself began to know the
want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve
it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash but
i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
plans therefore i had sent him the unopened pocket book by herbert to
hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfaction whether it
was a false kind or a true i hardly know in not having profited by his
generosity since his revelation of himself 
as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella
was married fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a
conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had
confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her
to me why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know why did you
who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last
year last month last week 
it was an unhappy life that i lived and its one dominant anxiety 
towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a
range of mountains never disappeared from my view still no new cause
for fear arose let me start from my bed as i would with the terror
fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as i would
with dread for herbert s returning step at night lest it should be
fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil news for all that and
much more to like purpose the round of things went on condemned to
inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed
about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could 
there were states of the tide when having been down the river i could
not get back through the eddy chafed arches and starlings of old london
bridge then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be
brought up afterwards to the temple stairs i was not averse to doing
this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
water side people there from this slight occasion sprang two meetings
that i have now to tell of 
one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf
at dusk i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and
had turned with the tide it had been a fine bright day but had become
foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the
shipping pretty carefully both in going and returning i had seen the
signal in his window all well 
as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort
myself with dinner at once and as i had hours of dejection and solitude
before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go
to the play the theatre where mr wopsle had achieved his questionable
triumph was in that water side neighborhood it is nowhere now and
to that theatre i resolved to go i was aware that mr wopsle had
not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather
partaken of its decline he had been ominously heard of through the
play bills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of
noble birth and a monkey and herbert had seen him as a predatory
tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an
outrageous hat all over bells 
i dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chop house 
where there were maps of the world in porter pot rims on every half yard
of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knives to
this day there is scarcely a single chop house within the lord mayor s
dominions which is not geographical and wore out the time in dozing
over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners by
and by i roused myself and went to the play 
there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majesty s service a most
excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so
tight in some places and not quite so loose in others who knocked all
the little men s hats over their eyes though he was very generous and
brave and who wouldn t hear of anybody s paying taxes though he was
very patriotic he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in
the cloth and on that property married a young person in bed furniture 
with great rejoicings the whole population of portsmouth nine in
number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own
hands and shake everybody else s and sing fill fill a certain
dark complexioned swab however who wouldn t fill or do anything else
that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the
boatswain to be as black as his figure head proposed to two other
swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually
done the swab family having considerable political influence that it
took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought
about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters 
and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and
coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron
whom he couldn t confute with what he had overheard this led to mr 
wopsle s who had never been heard of before coming in with a star
and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the
admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot 
and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight
acknowledgment of his public services the boatswain unmanned for the
first time respectfully dried his eyes on the jack and then cheering
up and addressing mr wopsle as your honor solicited permission to
take him by the fin mr wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious
dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody
danced a hornpipe and from that corner surveying the public with a
discontented eye became aware of me 
the second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in
the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected
mr wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric
countenance and a shock of red curtain fringe for his hair engaged
in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great
cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner 
but he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for 
the genius of youthful love being in want of assistance on account of
the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice
of his daughter s heart by purposely falling upon the object in a
flour sack out of the first floor window summoned a sententious
enchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after
an apparently violent journey proved to be mr wopsle in a high crowned
hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm the business
of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at 
butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various colors 
he had a good deal of time on his hands and i observed with great
surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were
lost in amazement 
there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of mr 
wopsle s eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out i sat
thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
watch case and still i could not make it out i was still thinking
of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him
waiting for me near the door 
 how do you do said i shaking hands with him as we turned down the
street together i saw that you saw me 
 saw you mr pip he returned yes of course i saw you but who else
was there 
 who else 
 it is the strangest thing said mr wopsle drifting into his lost
look again and yet i could swear to him 
becoming alarmed i entreated mr wopsle to explain his meaning 
 whether i should have noticed him at first but for your being there 
said mr wopsle going on in the same lost way i can t be positive 
yet i think i should 
involuntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me
when i went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill 
 oh he can t be in sight said mr wopsle he went out before i went
off i saw him go 
having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected
this poor actor i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission 
therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing 
 i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you mr pip till i saw
that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a
ghost 
my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak
yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on
to induce me to connect these references with provis of course i was
perfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there 
 i dare say you wonder at me mr pip indeed i see you do but it is
so very strange you ll hardly believe what i am going to tell you i
could hardly believe it myself if you told me 
 indeed said i 
 no indeed mr pip you remember in old times a certain christmas day 
when you were quite a child and i dined at gargery s and some soldiers
came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended 
 i remember it very well 
 and you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that we
joined in it and that gargery took you on his back and that i took the
lead and you kept up with me as well as you could 
 i remember it all very well better than he thought except the last
clause 
 and you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that
there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely
handled and much mauled about the face by the other 
 i see it all before me 
 and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre 
and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes 
with the torchlight shining on their faces i am particular about
that with the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an
outer ring of dark night all about us 
 yes said i i remember all that 
 then mr pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight i saw
him over your shoulder 
 steady i thought i asked him then which of the two do you suppose
you saw 
 the one who had been mauled he answered readily and i ll swear i
saw him the more i think of him the more certain i am of him 
 this is very curious said i with the best assumption i could put on
of its being nothing more to me very curious indeed 
i cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation
threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeyson s
having been behind me like a ghost for if he had ever been out of my
thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was
in those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that i
should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if
i had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had
found him at my elbow i could not doubt either that he was there 
because i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger
there might be about us danger was always near and active 
i put such questions to mr wopsle as when did the man come in he
could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man 
it was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify
him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and
known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time how was
he dressed prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought in
black was his face at all disfigured no he believed not i believed
not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial
notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all
disfigured would have attracted my attention 
when mr wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i
extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment 
after the fatigues of the evening we parted it was between twelve and
one o clock when i reached the temple and the gates were shut no one
was near me when i went in and went home 
herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire but
there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what i
had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint 
as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the
castle i made this communication by letter i wrote it before i went to
bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me herbert
and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious and
we were very cautious indeed more cautious than before if that were
possible and i for my part never went near chinks s basin except
when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank as i looked at
anything else 
the second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred
about a week after the first i had again left my boat at the wharf
below bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and 
undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was
strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one
overtaking me it was mr jaggers s hand and he passed it through my
arm 
 as we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together where
are you bound for 
 for the temple i think said i 
 don t you know said mr jaggers 
 well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in
cross examination i do not know for i have not made up my mind 
 you are going to dine said mr jaggers you don t mind admitting
that i suppose 
 no i returned i don t mind admitting that 
 and are not engaged 
 i don t mind admitting also that i am not engaged 
 then said mr jaggers come and dine with me 
i was going to excuse myself when he added wemmick s coming so
i changed my excuse into an acceptance the few words i had uttered 
serving for the beginning of either and we went along cheapside
and slanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up
brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamp lighters scarcely
finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the
afternoon s bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out 
opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at
the hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall 
at the office in little britain there was the usual letter writing 
hand washing candle snuffing and safe locking that closed the
business of the day as i stood idle by mr jaggers s fire its rising
and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bo peep with me while the pair of coarse 
fat office candles that dimly lighted mr jaggers as he wrote in a
corner were decorated with dirty winding sheets as if in remembrance of
a host of hanged clients 
we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackney coach and 
as soon as we got there dinner was served although i should not have
thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much
as a look to wemmick s walworth sentiments yet i should have had no
objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way but it
was not to be done he turned his eyes on mr jaggers whenever he raised
them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were
twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one 
 did you send that note of miss havisham s to mr pip wemmick mr 
jaggers asked soon after we began dinner 
 no sir returned wemmick it was going by post when you brought mr 
pip into the office here it is he handed it to his principal instead
of to me 
 it s a note of two lines pip said mr jaggers handing it on sent
up to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your
address she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her you ll go down 
 yes said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those
terms 
 when do you think of going down 
 i have an impending engagement said i glancing at wemmick who was
putting fish into the post office that renders me rather uncertain of
my time at once i think 
 if mr pip has the intention of going at once said wemmick to mr 
jaggers he needn t write an answer you know 
receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled
that i would go to morrow and said so wemmick drank a glass of wine 
and looked with a grimly satisfied air at mr jaggers but not at me 
 so pip our friend the spider said mr jaggers has played his
cards he has won the pool 
it was as much as i could do to assent 
 hah he is a promising fellow in his way but he may not have it all
his own way the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to
be found out first if he should turn to and beat her 
 surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not
seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr jaggers 
 i didn t say so pip i am putting a case if he should turn to and
beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be
a question of intellect he certainly will not it would be chance
work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances because it s a toss up between two results 
 may i ask what they are 
 a fellow like our friend the spider answered mr jaggers either
beats or cringes he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but
he either beats or cringes ask wemmick his opinion 
 either beats or cringes said wemmick not at all addressing himself
to me 
 so here s to mrs bentley drummle said mr jaggers taking a decanter
of choicer wine from his dumb waiter and filling for each of us and
for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady s
satisfaction to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman 
it never will be now molly molly molly molly how slow you are
to day 
she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the
table as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two 
nervously muttering some excuse and a certain action of her fingers as
she spoke arrested my attention 
 what s the matter said mr jaggers 
 nothing only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather
painful to me 
the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting she stood
looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or
whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go 
her look was very intent surely i had seen exactly such eyes and such
hands on a memorable occasion very lately 
he dismissed her and she glided out of the room but she remained
before me as plainly as if she were still there i looked at those
hands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair and i
compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of 
and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband
and a stormy life i looked again at those hands and eyes of the
housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over
me when i last walked not alone in the ruined garden and through the
deserted brewery i thought how the same feeling had come back when i
saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stage coach
window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like
lightning when i had passed in a carriage not alone through a sudden
glare of light in a dark street i thought how one link of association
had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link 
wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a
chance swift from estella s name to the fingers with their knitting
action and the attentive eyes and i felt absolutely certain that this
woman was estella s mother 
mr jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed
the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal he nodded when i said
the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the
wine again and went on with his dinner 
only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the
room was very short and mr jaggers was sharp with her but her hands
were estella s hands and her eyes were estella s eyes and if she had
reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less
sure that my conviction was the truth 
it was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round 
quite as a matter of business just as he might have drawn his salary
when that came round and with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of
perpetual readiness for cross examination as to the quantity of wine 
his post office was as indifferent and ready as any other post office
for its quantity of letters from my point of view he was the wrong
twin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth 
we took our leave early and left together even when we were groping
among mr jaggers s stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right
twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down
gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was
walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had
evaporated into the evening air 
 well said wemmick that s over he s a wonderful man without his
living likeness but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine
with him and i dine more comfortably unscrewed 
i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so 
 wouldn t say it to anybody but yourself he answered i know that
what is said between you and me goes no further 
i asked him if he had ever seen miss havisham s adopted daughter mrs 
bentley drummle he said no to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke
of the aged and of miss skiffins he looked rather sly when i mentioned
miss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll
of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness 
 wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to
mr jaggers s private house to notice that housekeeper 
 did i he replied ah i dare say i did deuce take me he added 
suddenly i know i did i find i am not quite unscrewed yet 
 a wild beast tamed you called her 
 and what do you call her 
 the same how did mr jaggers tame her wemmick 
 that s his secret she has been with him many a long year 
 i wish you would tell me her story i feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it you know that what is said between you and me
goes no further 
 well wemmick replied i don t know her story that is i don t know
all of it but what i do know i ll tell you we are in our private and
personal capacities of course 
 of course 
 a score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for
murder and was acquitted she was a very handsome young woman and i
believe had some gypsy blood in her anyhow it was hot enough when it
was up as you may suppose 
 but she was acquitted 
 mr jaggers was for her pursued wemmick with a look full of meaning 
 and worked the case in a way quite astonishing it was a desperate
case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked
it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to have made
him he worked it himself at the police office day after day for many
days contending against even a committal and at the trial where he
couldn t work it himself sat under counsel and every one knew put
in all the salt and pepper the murdered person was a woman a woman a
good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger it was
a case of jealousy they both led tramping lives and this woman in
gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as
we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy 
the murdered woman more a match for the man certainly in point of
years was found dead in a barn near hounslow heath there had been a
violent struggle perhaps a fight she was bruised and scratched and
torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked now there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and
on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it mr jaggers
principally rested his case you may be sure said wemmick touching me
on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then 
though he sometimes does now 
i had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner
party 
 well sir wemmick went on it happened happened don t you
see that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of
her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in
particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look she had only a bruise
or two about her nothing for a tramp but the backs of her hands
were lacerated and the question was was it with finger nails now mr 
jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles
which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got
through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles were
actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that
the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken
through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of
blood upon them here and there but the boldest point he made was this 
it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was
under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder 
frantically destroyed her child by this man some three years old to
revenge herself upon him mr jaggers worked that in this way we say
these are not marks of finger nails but marks of brambles and we show
you the brambles you say they are marks of finger nails and you set
up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child you must accept all
consequences of that hypothesis for anything we know she may have
destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched
her hands what then you are not trying her for the murder of her
child why don t you as to this case if you will have scratches 
we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them 
assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them to
sum up sir said wemmick mr jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury and they gave in 
 has she been in his service ever since 
 yes but not only that said wemmick she went into his service
immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now she has since been
taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed
from the beginning 
 do you remember the sex of the child 
 said to have been a girl 
 you have nothing more to say to me to night 
 nothing i got your letter and destroyed it nothing 
we exchanged a cordial good night and i went home with new matter for
my thoughts though with no relief from the old 
putting miss havisham s note in my pocket that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her
waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went
down again by the coach next day but i alighted at the halfway house 
and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for i sought
to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it
in the same manner 
the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing
courts behind the high street the nooks of ruin where the old monks had
once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were
now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost
as silent as the old monks in their graves the cathedral chimes had at
once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding
observation than they had ever had before so the swell of the old
organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks as they
hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the
priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that
estella was gone out of it for ever 
an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who
lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the
gate the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old 
and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone miss havisham was not
in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing looking
in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth
in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the
ashy fire 
doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old
chimney piece where she could see me when she raised her eyes there
was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to
pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge
her with as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the
progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of
that house her eyes rested on me she stared and said in a low voice 
 is it real 
 it is i pip mr jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost
no time 
 thank you thank you 
as i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i
remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me 
 i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you
were last here and to show you that i am not all stone but perhaps you
can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart 
when i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right
hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again
before i understood the action or knew how to receive it 
 you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do
something useful and good something that you would like done is it
not 
 something that i would like done very much 
 what is it 
i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership i had
not got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking
in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said it seemed to be
so for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed
that she was conscious of the fact 
 do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid
of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me 
 no no i answered how can you think so miss havisham i stopped
because i thought you were not following what i said 
 perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head begin
again and let me look at something else stay now tell me 
she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend i went on with my explanation and told her
how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how
in this i was disappointed that part of the subject i reminded her 
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they
were the weighty secrets of another 
 so said she assenting with her head but not looking at me and how
much money is wanting to complete the purchase 
i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum nine
hundred pounds 
 if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as
you have kept your own 
 quite as faithfully 
 and your mind will be more at rest 
 much more at rest 
 are you very unhappy now 
she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted
tone of sympathy i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed
me she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid
her forehead on it 
 i am far from happy miss havisham but i have other causes of disquiet
than any you know of they are the secrets i have mentioned 
after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again 
 it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
unhappiness is it true 
 too true 
 can i only serve you pip by serving your friend regarding that as
done is there nothing i can do for you yourself 
 nothing i thank you for the question i thank you even more for the
tone of the question but there is nothing 
she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room
for the means of writing there were none there and she took from her
pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and
wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from
her neck 
 you are still on friendly terms with mr jaggers 
 quite i dined with him yesterday 
 this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your
irresponsible discretion for your friend i keep no money here but if
you would rather mr jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it
to you 
 thank you miss havisham i have not the least objection to receiving
it from him 
she read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled
again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached and put it in mine all this she did without
looking at me 
 my name is on the first leaf if you can ever write under my name i
forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
it 
 o miss havisham said i i can do it now there have been sore
mistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and i want
forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you 
she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it 
and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees
at my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which 
when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have
been raised to heaven from her mother s side 
to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet
gave me a shock through all my frame i entreated her to rise and got
my arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine
which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept i
had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the
relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking she was not
kneeling now but was down upon the ground 
 o she cried despairingly what have i done what have i done 
 if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me
answer very little i should have loved her under any circumstances is
she married 
 yes 
it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house
had told me so 
 what have i done what have i done she wrung her hands and crushed
her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again what have
i done 
i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her that she had done a
grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found
vengeance in i knew full well but that in shutting out the light
of day she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had
secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that 
her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and
must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew
equally well and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her
punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth
on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a
master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the
vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been
curses in this world 
 until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a
looking glass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know
what i had done what have i done what have i done and so again 
twenty fifty times over what had she done 
 miss havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience but estella is a different case and if
you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past through a hundred years 
 yes yes i know it but pip my dear there was an earnest womanly
compassion for me in her new affection my dear believe this when she
first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own at first 
i meant no more 
 well well said i i hope so 
 but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did
worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings 
and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and
point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place 
 better i could not help saying to have left her a natural heart 
even to be bruised or broken 
with that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then
burst out again what had she done 
 if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion
for me and a better understanding of me 
 miss havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may
say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left
this neighborhood it has inspired me with great commiseration and i
hope i understand it and its influences does what has passed between us
give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to estella not as
she is but as she was when she first came here 
she was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and
her head leaning on them she looked full at me when i said this and
replied go on 
 whose child was estella 
she shook her head 
 you don t know 
she shook her head again 
 but mr jaggers brought her here or sent her here 
 brought her here 
 will you tell me how that came about 
she answered in a low whisper and with caution i had been shut up in
these rooms a long time i don t know how long you know what time the
clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear
and love and save from my fate i had first seen him when i sent
for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the
newspapers before i and the world parted he told me that he would
look about him for such an orphan child one night he brought her here
asleep and i called her estella 
 might i ask her age then 
 two or three she herself knows nothing but that she was left an
orphan and i adopted her 
so convinced i was of that woman s being her mother that i wanted
no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind but to any mind i
thought the connection here was clear and straight 
what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview i had
succeeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew
of estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind no matter
with what other words we parted we parted 
twilight was closing in when i went down stairs into the natural air i
called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would
not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving 
for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt
that the dying light was suited to my last view of it 
by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which
the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and
leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
end i made my way to the ruined garden i went all round it round by
the corner where herbert and i had fought our battle round by the paths
where estella and i had walked so cold so lonely so dreary all 
taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little
door at the garden end of it and walked through i was going out at the
opposite door not easy to open now for the damp wood had started and
swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered
with a growth of fungus when i turned my head to look back a childish
association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight
action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to the beam so
strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from
head to foot before i knew it was a fancy though to be sure i was
there in an instant 
the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of
this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i
had once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart passing on into
the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out
at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go up stairs
and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i had left
her i took the latter course and went up 
i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the
ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards
me in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away 
i saw a great flaming light spring up in the same moment i saw her
running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her 
and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high 
i had a double caped great coat on and over my arm another thick coat 
that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over
her that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose 
and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and
all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the ground
struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her 
the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself that this
occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or
thought or knew i did i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the
floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were
floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded
bridal dress 
then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like
a prisoner who might escape and i doubt if i even knew who she was or
why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames
were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments
no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us 
she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even
touched assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if
i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire
would break out again and consume her when i got up on the surgeon s
coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hands
were burnt for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling 
on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts 
but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay
mainly in the nervous shock by the surgeon s directions her bed was
carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to
be well suited to the dressing of her injuries when i saw her again an
hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick 
and had heard her say that she would lie one day 
though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she
still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had
covered her to the throat with white cotton wool and as she lay with
a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that
had been and was changed was still upon her 
i found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i
got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the
next post miss havisham s family i took upon myself intending to
communicate with mr matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he
liked about informing the rest this i did next day through herbert as
soon as i returned to town 
there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had
happened though with a certain terrible vivacity towards midnight she
began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that
she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice what have i done 
and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like
mine and then take the pencil and write under my name i forgive
her she never changed the order of these three sentences but she
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in
another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word 
as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing
reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive
out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would
return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being
taken up clear of the town at about six o clock of the morning 
therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as
they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write
under my name i forgive her 
my hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in
the morning my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less
severely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames
had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse my right
hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers it was
bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and
arm those i carried in a sling and i could only wear my coat like a
cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck my hair had
been caught by the fire but not my head or face 
when herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came
back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me he
was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages 
and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them
on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for 
at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i
might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell if i
dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss havisham s cries and by her
running at me with all that height of fire above her head this pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i
suffered and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention
engaged 
neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it that
was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our
agreeing without agreement to make my recovery of the use of my hands
a question of so many hours not of so many weeks 
my first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all
was well down the river as he replied in the affirmative with perfect
confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day
was wearing away but then as herbert changed the bandages more by
the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it
spontaneously 
 i sat with provis last night handel two good hours 
 where was clara 
 dear little thing said herbert she was up and down with
gruffandgrim all the evening he was perpetually pegging at the floor
the moment she left his sight i doubt if he can hold out long though 
what with rum and pepper and pepper and rum i should think his
pegging must be nearly over 
 and then you will be married herbert 
 how can i take care of the dear child otherwise lay your arm out upon
the back of the sofa my dear boy and i ll sit down here and get the
bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes i was
speaking of provis do you know handel he improves 
 i said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw him 
 so you did and so he is he was very communicative last night and
told me more of his life you remember his breaking off here about some
woman that he had had great trouble with did i hurt you 
i had started but not under his touch his words had given me a start 
 i had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of it 
 well he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is 
shall i tell you or would it worry you just now 
 tell me by all means every word 
herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been
rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for your
head is cool he said touching it 
 quite said i tell me what provis said my dear herbert 
 it seems said herbert there s a bandage off most charmingly and
now comes the cool one makes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow 
don t it but it will be comfortable presently it seems that the
woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman 
revengeful handel to the last degree 
 to what last degree 
 murder does it strike too cold on that sensitive place 
 i don t feel it how did she murder whom did she murder 
 why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name 
said herbert but she was tried for it and mr jaggers defended
her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known
to provis it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim 
and there had been a struggle in a barn who began it or how fair
it was or how unfair may be doubtful but how it ended is
certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled 
 was the woman brought in guilty 
 no she was acquitted my poor handel i hurt you 
 it is impossible to be gentler herbert yes what else 
 this acquitted young woman and provis had a little child a little
child of whom provis was exceedingly fond on the evening of the very
night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the
young woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore
that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he
should never see it again then she vanished there s the worst arm
comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right
hand which is a far easier job i can do it better by this light
than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i don t see the poor
blistered patches too distinctly you don t think your breathing is
affected my dear boy you seem to breathe quickly 
 perhaps i do herbert did the woman keep her oath 
 there comes the darkest part of provis s life she did 
 that is he says she did 
 why of course my dear boy returned herbert in a tone of surprise 
and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me he says it all i
have no other information 
 no to be sure 
 now whether pursued herbert he had used the child s mother ill or
whether he had used the child s mother well provis doesn t say but she
had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described
to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and
forbearance towards her therefore fearing he should be called upon to
depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he
hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he
says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked
of as a certain man called abel out of whom the jealousy arose after
the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the
child s mother 
 i want to ask 
 a moment my dear boy and i have done that evil genius compeyson 
the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping
out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course
afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him
poorer and working him harder it was clear last night that this barbed
the point of provis s animosity 
 i want to know said i and particularly herbert whether he told
you when this happened 
 particularly let me remember then what he said as to that his
expression was a round score o year ago and a most directly after i
took up wi compeyson how old were you when you came upon him in the
little churchyard 
 i think in my seventh year 
 ay it had happened some three or four years then he said and you
brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have
been about your age 
 herbert said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see
me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire 
 by the firelight answered herbert coming close again 
 look at me 
 i do look at you my dear boy 
 touch me 
 i do touch you my dear boy 
 you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much
disordered by the accident of last night 
 n no my dear boy said herbert after taking time to examine me you
are rather excited but you are quite yourself 
 i know i am quite myself and the man we have in hiding down the river 
is estella s father 
what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving
estella s parentage i cannot say it will presently be seen that the
question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
me by a wiser head than my own 
but when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized
with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter down that i
ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see mr jaggers and come
at the bare truth i really do not know whether i felt that i did this
for estella s sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in
whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic
interest that had so long surrounded me perhaps the latter possibility
may be the nearer to the truth 
any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street
that night herbert s representations that if i did i should probably
be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitive s safety would depend
upon me alone restrained my impatience on the understanding again
and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to mr jaggers
to morrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts
looked after and to stay at home early next morning we went out
together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left
herbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain 
there were periodical occasions when mr jaggers and wemmick went over
the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things
straight on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into mr 
jaggers s room and one of the up stairs clerks came down into the outer
office finding such clerk on wemmick s post that morning i knew
what was going on but i was not sorry to have mr jaggers and wemmick
together as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to
compromise him 
my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders 
favored my object although i had sent mr jaggers a brief account of
the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all
the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk
to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of
evidence than it had been before while i described the disaster mr 
jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire wemmick leaned
back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his
trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post the two brutal
casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings 
seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn t smell fire at
the present moment 
my narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced
miss havisham s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
herbert mr jaggers s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when
i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick 
with instructions to draw the check for his signature while that was
in course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and mr 
jaggers poising and swaying himself on his well polished boots looked
on at me i am sorry pip said he as i put the check in my pocket 
when he had signed it that we do nothing for you 
 miss havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she
could do nothing for me and i told her no 
 everybody should know his own business said mr jaggers and i saw
wemmick s lips form the words portable property 
 i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr jaggers 
 but every man ought to know his own business best 
 every man s business said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me 
 is portable property 
as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at
heart i said turning on mr jaggers 
 i did ask something of miss havisham however sir i asked her to give
me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me
all she possessed 
 did she said mr jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and
then straightening himself hah i don t think i should have done so 
if i had been miss havisham but she ought to know her own business
best 
 i know more of the history of miss havisham s adopted child than miss
havisham herself does sir i know her mother 
mr jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother 
 i have seen her mother within these three days 
 yes said mr jaggers 
 and so have you sir and you have seen her still more recently 
 yes said mr jaggers 
 perhaps i know more of estella s history than even you do said i i
know her father too 
a certain stop that mr jaggers came to in his manner he was too
self possessed to change his manner but he could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stop assured me that he did not
know who her father was this i had strongly suspected from provis s
account as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark 
which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not mr jaggers s
client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for
claiming his identity but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness
on mr jaggers s part before though i was quite sure of it now 
 so you know the young lady s father pip said mr jaggers 
 yes i replied and his name is provis from new south wales 
even mr jaggers started when i said those words it was the slightest
start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the
sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the
action of taking out his pocket handkerchief how wemmick received the
announcement i am unable to say for i was afraid to look at him just
then lest mr jaggers s sharpness should detect that there had been
some communication unknown to him between us 
 and on what evidence pip asked mr jaggers very coolly as he
paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does provis make
this claim 
 he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no
knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence 
for once the powerful pocket handkerchief failed my reply was so
unexpected that mr jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked
with stern attention at me though with an immovable face 
then i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the one reservation
that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact
knew from wemmick i was very careful indeed as to that nor did i look
towards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for
some time silently meeting mr jaggers s look when i did at last turn
my eyes in wemmick s direction i found that he had unposted his pen 
and was intent upon the table before him 
 hah said mr jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the
table what item was it you were at wemmick when mr pip came in 
but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a
passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and
manly with me i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had
lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had
made and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits i
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from
him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted i said that
i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted
assurance of the truth from him and if he asked me why i wanted it 
and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he
cared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long 
and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life 
whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world and seeing that mr jaggers stood quite still and
silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to
wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle
heart i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the
innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life and i entreat you to say a word for me to mr jaggers and to
represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more
open with me 
i have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than mr 
jaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe at first a misgiving
crossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
employment but it melted as i saw mr jaggers relax into something like
a smile and wemmick become bolder 
 what s all this said mr jaggers you with an old father and you
with pleasant and playful ways 
 well returned wemmick if i don t bring em here what does it
matter 
 pip said mr jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling
openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london 
 not a bit of it returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder i think
you re another 
again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him in 
 you with a pleasant home said mr jaggers 
 since it don t interfere with business returned wemmick let it be
so now i look at you sir i shouldn t wonder if you might be planning
and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days 
when you re tired of all this work 
mr jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and
actually drew a sigh pip said he we won t talk about poor
dreams you know more about such things than i having much fresher
experience of that kind but now about this other matter i ll put a
case to you mind i admit nothing 
he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly
said that he admitted nothing 
 now pip said mr jaggers put this case put the case that a
woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child
concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser 
on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the
latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child put the
case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up 
 i follow you sir 
 put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he
saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain
destruction put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at
a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that
he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported 
neglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing
up to be hanged put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw
in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much
spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his net to be
prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow 
 i follow you sir 
 put the case pip that here was one pretty little child out of the
heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make
no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this
power i know what you did and how you did it you came so and so you
did such and such things to divert suspicion i have tracked you through
it all and i tell it you all part with the child unless it should
be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced 
give the child into my hands and i will do my best to bring you off if
you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost your child is
still saved put the case that this was done and that the woman was
cleared 
 i understand you perfectly 
 but that i make no admissions 
 that you make no admissions and wemmick repeated no admissions 
 put the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the woman s intellects and that when she was set at liberty 
she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be
sheltered put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the
old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking
out by asserting his power over her in the old way do you comprehend
the imaginary case 
 quite 
 put the case that the child grew up and was married for money that
the mother was still living that the father was still living that the
mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many
miles furlongs yards if you like of one another that the secret was
still a secret except that you had got wind of it put that last case
to yourself very carefully 
 i do 
 i ask wemmick to put it to himself very carefully 
and wemmick said i do 
 for whose sake would you reveal the secret for the father s i think
he would not be much the better for the mother for the mother s i
think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was 
for the daughter s i think it would hardly serve her to establish her
parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to
disgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for
life but add the case that you had loved her pip and had made her the
subject of those poor dreams which have at one time or another been
in the heads of more men than you think likely then i tell you that you
had better and would much sooner when you had thought well of it chop
off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and
then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off too 
i looked at wemmick whose face was very grave he gravely touched his
lips with his forefinger i did the same mr jaggers did the same 
 now wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what
item was it you were at when mr pip came in 
standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times with
this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say
conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to
the other for this reason i suppose they were now inflexible with one
another mr jaggers being highly dictatorial and wemmick obstinately
justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for
a moment i had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they
got on very well indeed together 
but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike 
the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his
sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance within
those walls this individual who either in his own person or in that
of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in
that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter
was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting as he imparted this melancholy
circumstance to wemmick mr jaggers standing magisterially before the
fire and taking no share in the proceedings mike s eye happened to
twinkle with a tear 
 what are you about demanded wemmick with the utmost indignation 
 what do you come snivelling here for 
 i didn t go to do it mr wemmick 
 you did said wemmick how dare you you re not in a fit state to
come here if you can t come here without spluttering like a bad pen 
what do you mean by it 
 a man can t help his feelings mr wemmick pleaded mike 
 his what demanded wemmick quite savagely say that again 
 now look here my man said mr jaggers advancing a step and pointing
to the door get out of this office i ll have no feelings here get
out 
 it serves you right said wemmick get out 
so the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and mr jaggers and
wemmick appeared to have re established their good understanding and
went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had
just had lunch 
from little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss
skiffins s brother the accountant and miss skiffins s brother the
accountant going straight to clarriker s and bringing clarriker to me 
i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement it was the
only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done 
since i was first apprised of my great expectations 
clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house
were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a
small branch house in the east which was much wanted for the extension
of the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would
go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for
a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more
settled and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its
hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves 
but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home
of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told
me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara
barley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join
them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the
nile and seeing wonders without being sanguine as to my own part in
those bright plans i felt that herbert s way was clearing fast and
that old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his
daughter would soon be happily provided for 
we had now got into the month of march my left arm though it presented
no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i
was still unable to get a coat on my right arm was tolerably restored 
disfigured but fairly serviceable 
on a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received
the following letter from wemmick by the post 
 walworth burn this as soon as read early in the week or say
wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try
it now burn 
when i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the fire but not
before we had both got it by heart we considered what to do for of
course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view 
 i have thought it over again and again said herbert and i think i
know a better course than taking a thames waterman take startop a good
fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honorable 
i had thought of him more than once 
 but how much would you tell him herbert 
 it is necessary to tell him very little let him suppose it a mere
freak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know that
there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away you go
with him 
 no doubt 
 where 
it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the
point almost indifferent what port we made for hamburg rotterdam 
antwerp the place signified little so that he was out of england any
foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do 
i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the
boat certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for
search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot as foreign steamers would
leave london at about the time of high water our plan would be to get
down the river by a previous ebb tide and lie by in some quiet spot
until we could pull off to one the time when one would be due where we
lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we
made inquiries beforehand 
herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations we found that a steamer for
hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel but we noted down what other foreign
steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied
ourselves that we knew the build and color of each we then separated
for a few hours i to get at once such passports as were necessary 
herbert to see startop at his lodgings we both did what we had to do
without any hindrance and when we met again at one o clock reported
it done i for my part was prepared with passports herbert had seen
startop and he was more than ready to join 
those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer our
charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our object we
should make way enough we arranged that herbert should not come home to
dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening that he should
not go there at all to morrow evening tuesday that he should prepare
provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when
he saw us approach and not sooner that all the arrangements with
him should be concluded that monday night and that he should be
communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board 
these precautions well understood by both of us i went home 
on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter
in the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not ill written 
it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its
contents were these 
 if you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to night or to morrow
night at nine and to come to the little sluice house by the limekiln 
you had better come if you want information regarding your uncle
provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time you
must come alone bring this with you 
i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange
letter what to do now i could not tell and the worst was that i must
decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take
me down in time for to night to morrow night i could not think of
going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight and again 
for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important
bearing on the flight itself 
if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have
gone having hardly any time for consideration my watch showing me
that the coach started within half an hour i resolved to go i should
certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle provis that 
coming on wemmick s letter and the morning s busy preparation turned
the scale 
it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost
any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious
epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of
way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling him that as i should
be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry
down and back to ascertain for myself how miss havisham was faring 
i had then barely time to get my great coat lock up the chambers 
and make for the coach office by the short by ways if i had taken a
hackney chariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim 
going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard i
was the only inside passenger jolting away knee deep in straw when i
came to myself 
for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had
so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning the morning hurry
and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as i had waited for
wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last and now i began
to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had
sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should
get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an
anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases
of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried
people are strangers still the reference to provis by name mastered
everything i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing it if
that be reasoning in case any harm should befall him through my not
going how could i ever forgive myself 
it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary
to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside
in my disabled state avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of
minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner while it was
preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham she was
still very ill though considered something better 
my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i
dined in a little octagonal common room like a font as i was not able
to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for
me this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain
me with my own story of course with the popular feature that
pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes 
 do you know the young man said i 
 know him repeated the landlord ever since he was no height at
all 
 does he ever come back to this neighborhood 
 ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and
again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him 
 what man is that 
 him that i speak of said the landlord mr pumblechook 
 is he ungrateful to no one else 
 no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he
can t and why because pumblechook done everything for him 
 does pumblechook say so 
 say so replied the landlord he han t no call to say so 
 but does he say so 
 it would turn a man s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of
it sir said the landlord 
i thought yet joe dear joe you never tell of it long suffering and
loving joe you never complain nor you sweet tempered biddy 
 your appetite s been touched like by your accident said the landlord 
glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat try a tenderer bit 
 no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the
fire i can eat no more please take it away 
i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as
through the brazen impostor pumblechook the falser he the truer joe 
the meaner he the nobler joe 
my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire
for an hour or more the striking of the clock aroused me but not from
my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round
my neck and went out i had previously sought in my pockets for the
letter that i might refer to it again but i could not find it and
was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of
the coach i knew very well however that the appointed place was the
little sluice house by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine 
towards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare 
it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed
lands and passed out upon the marshes beyond their dark line there was
a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon 
in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the
piled mountains of cloud 
there was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal a
stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were
so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back but i knew
them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had
no excuse for returning being there so having come there against my
inclination i went on against it 
the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor
that in which we had pursued the convicts my back was turned towards
the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old lights
away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder i knew the
limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart 
so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there
would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright
specks 
at first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand
still while the cattle that were lying in the banked up pathway arose
and blundered down among the grass and reeds but after a little while i
seemed to have the whole flats to myself 
it was another half hour before i drew near to the kiln the lime was
burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and
left and no workmen were visible hard by was a small stone quarry it
lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the
tools and barrows that were lying about 
coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation for the rude
path lay through it i saw a light in the old sluice house i quickened
my pace and knocked at the door with my hand waiting for some reply 
i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and
how the house of wood with a tiled roof would not be proof against the
weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze
were coated with lime and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a
ghostly way towards me still there was no answer and i knocked again 
no answer still and i tried the latch 
it rose under my hand and the door yielded looking in i saw a lighted
candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead as
there was a loft above i called is there any one here but no voice
answered then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine 
called again is there any one here there being still no answer i
went out at the door irresolute what to do 
it was beginning to rain fast seeing nothing save what i had seen
already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter
of the doorway looking out into the night while i was considering that
some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or
the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the
wick were long i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in
my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next
thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running
noose thrown over my head from behind 
 now said a suppressed voice with an oath i ve got you 
 what is this i cried struggling who is it help help help 
not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on
my bad arm caused me exquisite pain sometimes a strong man s hand 
sometimes a strong man s breast was set against my mouth to deaden
my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled
ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall and
now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and
i ll make short work of you 
faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the
surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little 
but it was bound too tight for that i felt as if having been burnt
before it were now being boiled 
the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black
darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter 
after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he
wanted and began to strike a light i strained my sight upon the sparks
that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed 
match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of
the match even those but fitfully the tinder was damp no wonder
there and one after another the sparks died out 
the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel as
the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and
touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending
over the table but nothing more presently i saw his blue lips again 
breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and
showed me orlick 
whom i had looked for i don t know i had not looked for him seeing
him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes
upon him 
he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation 
and dropped the match and trod it out then he put the candle away from
him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded
on the table and looked at me i made out that i was fastened to a stout
perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall a fixture there the
means of ascent to the loft above 
 now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time i ve
got you 
 unbind me let me go 
 ah he returned i ll let you go i ll let you go to the moon i ll
let you go to the stars all in good time 
 why have you lured me here 
 don t you know said he with a deadly look 
 why have you set upon me in the dark 
 because i mean to do it all myself one keeps a secret better than two 
o you enemy you enemy 
his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms
folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a
malignity in it that made me tremble as i watched him in silence 
he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a
brass bound stock 
 do you know this said he making as if he would take aim at me do
you know where you saw it afore speak wolf 
 yes i answered 
 you cost me that place you did speak 
 what else could i do 
 you did that and that would be enough without more how dared you to
come betwixt me and a young woman i liked 
 when did i 
 when didn t you it was you as always give old orlick a bad name to
her 
 you gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself i could have done
you no harm if you had done yourself none 
 you re a liar and you ll take any pains and spend any money to drive
me out of this country will you said he repeating my words to biddy
in the last interview i had with her now i ll tell you a piece of
information it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this
country as it is to night ah if it was all your money twenty times
told to the last brass farden as he shook his heavy hand at me with
his mouth snarling like a tiger s i felt that it was true 
 what are you going to do to me 
 i m a going said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force i m
a going to have your life 
he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it
across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again 
 you was always in old orlick s way since ever you was a child you goes
out of his way this present night he ll have no more on you you re
dead 
i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave for a moment i looked
wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none 
 more than that said he folding his arms on the table again i won t
have a rag of you i won t have a bone of you left on earth i ll put
your body in the kiln i d carry two such to it on my shoulders and 
let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing 
my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
of such a death estella s father would believe i had deserted him 
would be taken would die accusing me even herbert would doubt me 
when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had
called at miss havisham s gate for only a moment joe and biddy would
never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what
i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed
through the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible
than death was the dread of being misremembered after death and
so quick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn
generations estella s children and their children while the
wretch s words were yet on his lips 
 now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beast which is
wot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up for i ll have a good look
at you and a good goad at you o you enemy 
it had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though
few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the
hopelessness of aid but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by
a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips above all things i
resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some
last poor resistance to him softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
men were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as i did of
heaven melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no
farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my
miserable errors still if i could have killed him even in dying i
would have done it 
he had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot around his
neck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink
slung about him in other days he brought the bottle to his lips and
took a fiery drink from it and i smelt the strong spirits that i saw
flash into his face 
 wolf said he folding his arms again old orlick s a going to tell
you somethink it was you as did for your shrew sister 
again my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted the
whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her death 
before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words 
 it was you villain said i 
 i tell you it was your doing i tell you it was done through you he
retorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the
vacant air between us i come upon her from behind as i come upon you
to night i giv it her i left her for dead and if there had been a
limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldn t have come
to life again but it warn t old orlick as did it it was you you was
favored and he was bullied and beat old orlick bullied and beat eh 
now you pays for it you done it now you pays for it 
he drank again and became more ferocious i saw by his tilting of
the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it i distinctly
understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an
end of me i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life i knew
that when i was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards
me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do
as he had done in my sister s case make all haste to the town and
be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses my rapid mind
pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it 
and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white
vapor creeping over it into which i should have dissolved 
it was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years
while he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented pictures
to me and not mere words in the excited and exalted state of my brain 
i could not think of a place without seeing it or of persons without
seeing them it is impossible to overstate the vividness of these
images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himself who
would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring that i knew of
the slightest action of his fingers 
when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which
he sat and pushed the table aside then he took up the candle and 
shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood
before me looking at me and enjoying the sight 
 wolf i ll tell you something more it was old orlick as you tumbled
over on your stairs that night 
i saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps i saw the shadows of
the heavy stair rails thrown by the watchman s lantern on the wall 
i saw the rooms that i was never to see again here a door half open 
there a door closed all the articles of furniture around 
 and why was old orlick there i ll tell you something more wolf 
you and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country so far as
getting a easy living in it goes and i ve took up with new companions 
and new masters some of em writes my letters when i wants em
wrote do you mind writes my letters wolf they writes fifty hands 
they re not like sneaking you as writes but one i ve had a firm mind
and a firm will to have your life since you was down here at your
sister s burying i han t seen a way to get you safe and i ve looked
arter you to know your ins and outs for says old orlick to himself 
 somehow or another i ll have him what when i looks for you i finds
your uncle provis eh 
mill pond bank and chinks s basin and the old green copper ropewalk 
all so clear and plain provis in his rooms the signal whose use was
over pretty clara the good motherly woman old bill barley on his
back all drifting by as on the swift stream of my life fast running
out to sea 
 you with a uncle too why i know d you at gargery s when you was so
small a wolf that i could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and
thumb and chucked you away dead as i d thoughts o doing odd times 
when i see you loitering amongst the pollards on a sunday and you
hadn t found no uncles then no not you but when old orlick come for
to hear that your uncle provis had most like wore the leg iron wot old
orlick had picked up filed asunder on these meshes ever so many year
ago and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it like
a bullock as he means to drop you hey when he come for to hear
that hey 
in his savage taunting he flared the candle so close at me that i
turned my face aside to save it from the flame 
 ah he cried laughing after doing it again the burnt child dreads
the fire old orlick knowed you was burnt old orlick knowed you was
smuggling your uncle provis away old orlick s a match for you and
know d you d come to night now i ll tell you something more wolf and
this ends it there s them that s as good a match for your uncle provis
as old orlick has been for you let him ware them when he s lost his
nevvy let him ware them when no man can t find a rag of his dear
relation s clothes nor yet a bone of his body there s them that can t
and that won t have magwitch yes i know the name alive in the same
land with them and that s had such sure information of him when he
was alive in another land as that he couldn t and shouldn t leave it
unbeknown and put them in danger p raps it s them that writes fifty
hands and that s not like sneaking you as writes but one ware
compeyson magwitch and the gallows 
he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an
instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the
light on the table i had thought a prayer and had been with joe and
biddy and herbert before he turned towards me again 
there was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite
wall within this space he now slouched backwards and forwards his
great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he
did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides and with
his eyes scowling at me i had no grain of hope left wild as my inward
hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me
instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand that unless he had
resolved that i was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all
human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told 
of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed
it away light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet he swallowed
slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at
me no more the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his
hand and licked up then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing
horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped and i saw in his
hand a stone hammer with a long heavy handle 
the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and
struggled with all my might it was only my head and my legs that i
could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until
then unknown that was within me in the same instant i heard responsive
shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door heard
voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men as if
it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly out into the
night 
after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the
same place with my head on some one s knee my eyes were fixed on the
ladder against the wall when i came to myself had opened on it before
my mind saw it and thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i
was in the place where i had lost it 
too indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who supported
me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it
a face the face of trabb s boy 
 i think he s all right said trabb s boy in a sober voice but ain t
he just pale though 
at these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine 
and i saw my supporter to be 
 herbert great heaven 
 softly said herbert gently handel don t be too eager 
 and our old comrade startop i cried as he too bent over me 
 remember what he is going to assist us in said herbert and be
calm 
the allusion made me spring up though i dropped again from the pain
in my arm the time has not gone by herbert has it what night is
to night how long have i been here for i had a strange and
strong misgiving that i had been lying there a long time a day and a
night two days and nights more 
 the time has not gone by it is still monday night 
 thank god 
 and you have all to morrow tuesday to rest in said herbert but
you can t help groaning my dear handel what hurt have you got can you
stand 
 yes yes said i i can walk i have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm 
they laid it bare and did what they could it was violently swollen and
inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched but they tore
up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced
it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling
lotion to put upon it in a little while we had shut the door of the
dark and empty sluice house and were passing through the quarry on our
way back trabb s boy trabb s overgrown young man now went before us
with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door but 
the moon was a good two hours higher than when i had last seen the sky 
and the night though rainy was much lighter the white vapor of the
kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer
before i thought a thanksgiving now 
entreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue which at
first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining
quiet i learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our
chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had
met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i
was gone its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him his
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an
hour s consideration he set off for the coach office with startop who
volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went
down finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his
uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he
resolved to follow in a post chaise so he and startop arrived at the
blue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but 
finding neither went on to miss havisham s where they lost me 
hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when
i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes among
the loungers under the boar s archway happened to be trabb s boy true
to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no
business and trabb s boy had seen me passing from miss havisham s in
the direction of my dining place thus trabb s boy became their guide 
and with him they went out to the sluice house though by the town way
to the marshes which i had avoided now as they went along herbert
reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to provis s safety and 
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous 
left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by
himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to
ascertain whether all was right within as he could hear nothing but
indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so
busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly
i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely
followed by the other two 
when i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our
immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it
was and getting out a warrant but i had already considered that such
a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might
be fatal to provis there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we
relinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time for the
present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather
light of the matter to trabb s boy who i am convinced would have been
much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention
saved me from the limekiln not that trabb s boy was of a malignant
nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his
constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody s expense when
we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his
views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of
him which made no impression on him at all 
wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london
that night three in the post chaise the rather as we should then be
clear away before the night s adventure began to be talked of herbert
got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff
dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain
on the journey it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went
at once to bed and lay in bed all day 
my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for
to morrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of
itself it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon
me that to morrow was so anxiously looked forward to charged with such
consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near 
no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him that day yet this again increased my
restlessness i started at every footstep and every sound believing
that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell
me so i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact
had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it as the days wore
on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell 
my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to morrow
morning altogether mastered me my burning arm throbbed and my burning
head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander i counted up to
high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew
in prose and verse it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
fatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot then i would say to
myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious 
they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and
gave me cooling drinks whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion
i had had in the sluice house that a long time had elapsed and the
opportunity to save him was gone about midnight i got out of bed
and went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for
four and twenty hours and that wednesday was past it was the last
self exhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept
soundly 
wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window the winking
lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a
marsh of fire on the horizon the river still dark and mysterious was
spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray with here and there
at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky as i looked along
the clustered roofs with church towers and spires shooting into the
unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from
the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters from me
too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well 
herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellow student lay asleep on
the sofa i could not dress myself without help but i made up the fire 
which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them in good
time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp
morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still
flowing towards us 
 when it turns at nine o clock said herbert cheerfully look out for
us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank 
it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind
blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade 
we had our pea coats with us and i took a bag of all my worldly
possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
bag where i might go what i might do or when i might return were
questions utterly unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for
it was wholly set on provis s safety i only wondered for the passing
moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered
circumstances i should next see those rooms if ever 
we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all of course i had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order after
a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went
on board and cast off herbert in the bow i steering it was then about
high water half past eight 
our plan was this the tide beginning to run down at nine and being
with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned 
and row against it until dark we should then be well in those long
reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is
broad and solitary where the water side inhabitants are very few and
where lone public houses are scattered here and there of which we could
choose one for a resting place there we meant to lie by all night 
the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from
london at about nine on thursday morning we should know at what time
to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first 
so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have
another chance we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel 
the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose
was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realize the condition in
which i had been a few hours before the crisp air the sunlight the
movement on the river and the moving river itself the road that ran
with us seeming to sympathize with us animate us and encourage us
on freshened me with new hope i felt mortified to be of so little use
in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and
they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day 
at that time the steam traffic on the thames was far below its present
extent and watermen s boats were far more numerous of barges sailing
colliers and coasting traders there were perhaps as many as now 
but of steam ships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part
so many early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and
there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide 
the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much
easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and we
went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly 
old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its
oyster boats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitor s gate and
we were in among the tiers of shipping here were the leith aberdeen 
and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely
high out of the water as we passed alongside here were colliers by the
score and score with the coal whippers plunging off stages on deck as
counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled
over the side into barges here at her moorings was to morrow s steamer
for rotterdam of which we took good notice and here to morrow s for
hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed and now i sitting in the
stern could see with a faster beating heart mill pond bank and mill
pond stairs 
 is he there said herbert 
 not yet 
 right he was not to come down till he saw us can you see his signal 
 not well from here but i think i see it now i see him pull both 
easy herbert oars 
we touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board 
and we were off again he had a boat cloak with him and a black canvas
bag and he looked as like a river pilot as my heart could have wished 
 dear boy he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his
seat faithful dear boy well done thankye thankye 
again among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty
chain cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the
moment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood
and shaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the
figure head of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds as
is done by many johns and the betsy of yarmouth with a firm formality
of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head in
and out hammers going in ship builders yards saws going at timber 
clashing engines going at things unknown pumps going in leaky ships 
capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible sea creatures
roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen in and
out out at last upon the clearer river where the ships boys might
take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled waters with them
over the side and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind 
at the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had
looked warily for any token of our being suspected i had seen none we
certainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not either
attended or followed by any boat if we had been waited on by any boat 
i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on or to
make her purpose evident but we held our own without any appearance of
molestation 
he had his boat cloak on him and looked as i have said a natural part
of the scene it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had
led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us he
was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his
gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not
disposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it but he had no
notion of meeting danger half way when it came upon him he confronted
it but it must come before he troubled himself 
 if you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here
alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day
betwixt four walls you d envy me but you don t know what it is 
 i think i know the delights of freedom i answered 
 ah said he shaking his head gravely but you don t know it equal to
me you must have been under lock and key dear boy to know it equal to
me but i ain t a going to be low 
it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he
should have endangered his freedom and even his life but i reflected
that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the
habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man i
was not far out since he said after smoking a little 
 you see dear boy when i was over yonder t other side the world i
was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for
all i was a growing rich everybody knowed magwitch and magwitch could
come and magwitch could go and nobody s head would be troubled about
him they ain t so easy concerning me here dear boy wouldn t be 
leastwise if they knowed where i was 
 if all goes well said i you will be perfectly free and safe again
within a few hours 
 well he returned drawing a long breath i hope so 
 and think so 
he dipped his hand in the water over the boat s gunwale and said 
smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me 
 ay i s pose i think so dear boy we d be puzzled to be more quiet
and easy going than we are at present but it s a flowing so soft
and pleasant through the water p raps as makes me think it i was
a thinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the
bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river
what i catches hold of nor yet we can t no more hold their tide than
i can hold this and it s run through my fingers and gone you see 
holding up his dripping hand 
 but for your face i should think you were a little despondent said i 
 not a bit on it dear boy it comes of flowing on so quiet and of that
there rippling at the boat s head making a sort of a sunday tune maybe
i m a growing a trifle old besides 
he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of
face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
england yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been
in constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
into the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he would
be safest where he was and he said do you dear boy and quietly sat
down again 
the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the
sunshine was very cheering the tide ran strong i took care to lose
none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well by
imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the
nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy
banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend as our
charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a boat or
two s length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the
stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large
transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us and soon
the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing 
and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking
advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us
in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of
the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and
mudbanks 
our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive
with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hour s rest
proved full as much as they wanted we got ashore among some slippery
stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about 
it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a
dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great
floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed
stranded and still for now the last of the fleet of ships was round
the last low point we had headed and the last green barge straw laden 
with a brown sail had followed and some ballast lighters shaped like
a child s first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud and a
little squat shoal lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud
on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy
stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck
out of the mud and an old landing stage and an old roofless building
slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud 
we pushed off again and made what way we could it was much harder work
now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed
until the sun went down by that time the river had lifted us a little 
so that we could see above the bank there was the red sun on the low
level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black and
there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising
grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and
there in the foreground a melancholy gull 
as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full 
would not rise early we held a little council a short one for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find so 
they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a
house thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles it
was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galley fire smoking
and flaring looked like a comfortable home the night was as dark by
this time as it would be until morning and what light we had seemed
to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping
struck at a few reflected stars 
at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that
we were followed as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular
intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or
other of us was sure to start and look in that direction here and
there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them
nervously sometimes what was that ripple one of us would say in a
low voice or another is that a boat yonder and afterwards we would
fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what
an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels 
at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran
alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
by leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light
to be in a window of a public house it was a dirty place enough and i
dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good
fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various
liquors to drink also there were two double bedded rooms such as
they were the landlord said no other company was in the house than
the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the
little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low water
mark too 
with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came
ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boat hook and all
else and hauled her up for the night we made a very good meal by the
kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms herbert and startop
were to occupy one i and our charge the other we found the air as
carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there
were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have
thought the family possessed but we considered ourselves well off 
notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found 
while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the
jack who was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes
on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as
interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of
a drowned seaman washed ashore asked me if we had seen a four oared
galley going up with the tide when i told him no he said she must have
gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there 
 they must ha thought better on t for some reason or another said the
jack and gone down 
 a four oared galley did you say said i 
 a four said the jack and two sitters 
 did they come ashore here 
 they put in with a stone two gallon jar for some beer i d ha been
glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling
physic in it 
 why 
 i know why said the jack he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud
had washed into his throat 
 he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye 
who seemed to rely greatly on his jack he thinks they was what they
wasn t 
 i knows what i thinks observed the jack 
 you thinks custum us jack said the landlord 
 i do said the jack 
 then you re wrong jack 
 am i 
in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in
his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into
it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on
again he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could
afford to do anything 
 why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then 
jack asked the landlord vacillating weakly 
 done with their buttons returned the jack chucked em overboard 
swallered em sowed em to come up small salad done with their
buttons 
 don t be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and
pathetic way 
 a custum us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack 
repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they
comes betwixt him and his own light a four and two sitters don t go
hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both
with and against another without there being custum us at the bottom
of it saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord having no
one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject 
this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy the dismal wind
was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and
i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened a four oared galley
hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly
circumstance that i could not get rid of when i had induced provis to
go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this
time knew the state of the case and held another council whether we
should remain at the house until near the steamer s time which would
be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the
morning was the question we discussed on the whole we deemed it the
better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the
steamer s time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with
the tide having settled to do this we returned into the house and went
to bed 
i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a
few hours when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house
 the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled
me rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the
window it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and 
as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw
two men looking into her they passed by under the window looking at
nothing else and they did not go down to the landing place which i
could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction
of the nore 
my first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going
away but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day
than i and were fatigued i forbore going back to my window i could
see the two men moving over the marsh in that light however i soon
lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and
fell asleep again 
we were up early as we walked to and fro all four together before
breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen again our
charge was the least anxious of the party it was very likely that the
men belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no
thought of us i tried to persuade myself that it was so as indeed 
it might easily be however i proposed that he and i should walk away
together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take
us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about
noon this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he
and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern 
he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on
the shoulder one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger 
not he and that he was reassuring me we spoke very little as we
approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while
i went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had passed
in the night he complied and i went on alone there was no boat off
the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any
signs of the men having embarked there but to be sure the tide was
high and there might have been some footpints under water 
when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i
waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited 
sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving
about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round we got
aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer by that time
it wanted but ten minutes of one o clock and we began to look out for
her smoke 
but it was half past one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards
we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer as they were coming on
at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity
of saying good by to herbert and startop we had all shaken hands
cordially and neither herbert s eyes nor mine were quite dry when i
saw a four oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
ahead of us and row out into the same track 
a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer s smoke 
by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible 
coming head on i called to herbert and startop to keep before the tide 
that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to sit
quite still wrapped in his cloak he answered cheerily trust to me 
dear boy and sat like a statue meantime the galley which was very
skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen
alongside leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept
alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we
pulled of the two sitters one held the rudder lines and looked at us
attentively as did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up 
much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction
to the steerer as he looked at us not a word was spoken in either boat 
startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first 
and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face 
she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder
and louder i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the
galley hailed us i answered 
 you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines 
 that s the man wrapped in the cloak his name is abel magwitch 
otherwise provis i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender 
and you to assist 
at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew 
he ran the galley abroad of us they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead 
had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to
our gunwale before we knew what they were doing this caused great
confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and
heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt
her driving down upon us irresistibly in the same moment i saw the
steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner s shoulder and saw
that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and
saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
frantically still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start
up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the
shrinking sitter in the galley still in the same moment i saw that the
face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago still in
the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it
that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer 
and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me 
it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand
mill weirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past i was
taken on board the galley herbert was there and startop was there but
our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone 
what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of
her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first
distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the
galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong
strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and
eagerly at the water astern presently a dark object was seen in it 
bearing towards us on the tide no man spoke but the steersman held up
his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and
true before it as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming 
but not swimming freely he was taken on board and instantly manacled
at the wrists and ankles 
the galley was kept steady and the silent eager look out at the water
was resumed but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not
understanding what had happened came on at speed by the time she had
been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and
we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water the look out was
kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but
everybody knew that it was hopeless now 
at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise here
i was able to get some comforts for magwitch provis no longer who
had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the
head 
he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising the injury to
his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought
he had received against the side of the galley he added that he did not
pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but
that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him 
that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone
overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him magwitch out of
our boat and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it had capsized
us he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in
each other s arms and that there had been a struggle under water and
that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away 
i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me 
the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going
overboard 
when i asked this officer s permission to change the prisoner s
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the
public house he gave it readily merely observing that he must take
charge of everything his prisoner had about him so the pocket book
which had once been in my hands passed into the officer s he further
gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london but declined to
accord that grace to my two friends 
the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
likeliest to come ashore his interest in its recovery seemed to me to
be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on probably it
took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may
have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in
various stages of decay 
we remained at the public house until the tide turned and then magwitch
was carried down to the galley and put on board herbert and startop
were to get to london by land as soon as they could we had a doleful
parting and when i took my place by magwitch s side i felt that that
was my place henceforth while he lived 
for now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted 
wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man
who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately 
gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a
series of years i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to
joe 
his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on 
and often he could not repress a groan i tried to rest him on the arm
i could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that
i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was
unquestionably best that he should die that there were still living 
people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not
doubt that he would be leniently treated i could not hope he who had
been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken
prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation
under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who
was the cause of his arrest 
as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us 
and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how
grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake 
 dear boy he answered i m quite content to take my chance i ve seen
my boy and he can be a gentleman without me 
no i had thought about that while we had been there side by side no 
apart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmick s hint now 
i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to
the crown 
 lookee here dear boy said he it s best as a gentleman should not be
knowed to belong to me now only come to see me as if you come by chance
alonger wemmick sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the
last o many times and i don t ask no more 
 i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be
near you please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me 
i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away
as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his
throat softened now like all the rest of him it was a good thing
that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not
otherwise have thought of until too late that he need never know how
his hopes of enriching me had perished 
he was taken to the police court next day and would have been
immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down
for an old officer of the prison ship from which he had once escaped to
speak to his identity nobody doubted it but compeyson who had meant
to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that
there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give
the required evidence i had gone direct to mr jaggers at his private
house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and mr 
jaggers on the prisoner s behalf would admit nothing it was the sole
resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes
when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its
going against us 
i imparted to mr jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the
fate of his wealth mr jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialize
by and by and try at all events for some of it but he did not conceal
from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture
would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make
it one of them i understood that very well i was not related to the
outlaw or connected with him by any recognizable tie he had put his
hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension 
and to do so now would be idle i had no claim and i finally resolved 
and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never
be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one 
there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer
had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some
accurate knowledge of magwitch s affairs when his body was found many
miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he
was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets notes were still
legible folded in a case he carried among these were the name of a
banking house in new south wales where a sum of money was and the
designation of certain lands of considerable value both these heads of
information were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to mr 
jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit his ignorance 
poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but that my
inheritance was quite safe with mr jaggers s aid 
after three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over
for the production of the witness from the prison ship the witness
came and completed the easy case he was committed to take his trial at
the next sessions which would come on in a month 
it was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one
evening a good deal cast down and said 
 my dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave you 
his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he
thought 
 we shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i am
very much afraid i must go handel when you most need me 
 herbert i shall always need you because i shall always love you but
my need is no greater now than at another time 
 you will be so lonely 
 i have not leisure to think of that said i you know that i am
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i
should be with him all day long if i could and when i come away from
him you know that my thoughts are with him 
the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both
of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words 
 my dear fellow said herbert let the near prospect of our
separation for it is very near be my justification for troubling you
about yourself have you thought of your future 
 no for i have been afraid to think of any future 
 but yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear handel it must not
be dismissed i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly
words go with me 
 i will said i 
 in this branch house of ours handel we must have a 
i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said a
clerk 
 a clerk and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner now 
handel in short my dear boy will you come to me 
there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of
a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone 
stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy 
 clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert pursued 
 and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in
her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come
together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her
husband s friend that he is her friend too we should get on so well 
handel 
i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not
yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered firstly my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly 
secondly yes secondly there was a vague something lingering in my
thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative 
 but if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury
to your business leave the question open for a little while 
 for any while cried herbert six months a year 
 not so long as that said i two or three months at most 
herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement 
and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
go away at the end of the week 
 and clara said i 
 the dear little thing returned herbert holds dutifully to her
father as long as he lasts but he won t last long mrs whimple
confides to me that he is certainly going 
 not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go 
 i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert and then i shall
come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i
will walk quietly into the nearest church remember the blessed darling
comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book 
and hasn t a notion about her grandpapa what a fortune for the son of
my mother 
on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbert full
of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave me as he sat on one of the
seaport mail coaches i went into a coffee house to write a little note
to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and
over again and then went to my lonely home if it deserved the name 
for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere 
on the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an
unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door i had not seen him
alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had
come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of
explanation in reference to that failure 
 the late compeyson said wemmick had by little and little got at the
bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from
the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being
always in trouble that i heard what i did i kept my ears open seeming
to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that
would be the best time for making the attempt i can only suppose now 
that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to
deceive his own instruments you don t blame me i hope mr pip i am
sure i tried to serve you with all my heart 
 i am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most
earnestly for all your interest and friendship 
 thank you thank you very much it s a bad job said wemmick 
scratching his head and i assure you i haven t been so cut up for a
long time what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property 
dear me 
 what i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the property 
 yes to be sure said wemmick of course there can be no objection
to your being sorry for him and i d put down a five pound note myself
to get him out of it but what i look at is this the late compeyson
having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being
so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been
saved whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved 
that s the difference between the property and the owner don t you
see 
i invited wemmick to come up stairs and refresh himself with a glass
of grog before walking to walworth he accepted the invitation while he
was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to
it and after having appeared rather fidgety 
 what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday mr pip 
 why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months 
 these twelve years more likely said wemmick yes i m going to take
a holiday more than that i m going to take a walk more than that i m
going to ask you to take a walk with me 
i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then 
when wemmick anticipated me 
 i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts 
mr pip but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness 
it ain t a long walk and it s an early one say it might occupy you
 including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve couldn t you
stretch a point and manage it 
he had done so much for me at various times that this was very little
to do for him i said i could manage it would manage it and he was
so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too at his
particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half
past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time 
punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday
morning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking
tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on within there were two
glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits the aged must have
been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his
bedroom i observed that his bed was empty 
when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was
considerably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishing rod and put
it over his shoulder why we are not going fishing said i no 
returned wemmick but i like to walk with one 
i thought this odd however i said nothing and we set off we went
towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said
suddenly 
 halloa here s a church 
there was nothing very surprising in that but again i was rather
surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea 
 let s go in 
we went in wemmick leaving his fishing rod in the porch and looked all
round in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coat pockets and
getting something out of paper there 
 halloa said he here s a couple of pair of gloves let s put em
on 
as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the post office was widened
to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions they
were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side
door escorting a lady 
 halloa said wemmick here s miss skiffins let s have a wedding 
that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now
engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white the
aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for
the altar of hymen the old gentleman however experienced so much
difficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary
to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe
resistance by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to
perfection 
the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at
those fatal rails true to his notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out of
his waistcoat pocket before the service began halloa here s a ring 
i acted in the capacity of backer or best man to the bridegroom while
a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby s made a feint
of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins the responsibility of giving
the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergyman s being
unintentionally scandalized and it happened thus when he said who
giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentlemen not in
the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood
most amiably beaming at the ten commandments upon which the clergyman
said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the
bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice now aged p you know who
giveth to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying
that he gave all right john all right my boy and the clergyman
came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment
whether we should get completely married that day 
it was completely done however and when we were going out of church
wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and
put the cover on again mrs wemmick more heedful of the future put
her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green now mr pip 
said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishing rod as we came
out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
wedding party 
breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so
away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle
board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
the solemnity it was pleasant to observe that mrs wemmick no longer
unwound wemmick s arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a
high backed chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and
submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done 
we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on
table wemmick said provided by contract you know don t be afraid of
it i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle 
saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could 
wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with him 
and wished him joy 
 thankee said wemmick rubbing his hands she s such a manager
of fowls you have no idea you shall have some eggs and judge for
yourself i say mr pip calling me back and speaking low this is
altogether a walworth sentiment please 
 i understand not to be mentioned in little britain said i 
wemmick nodded after what you let out the other day mr jaggers
may as well not know of it he might think my brain was softening or
something of the kind 
he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his
committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions he had broken
two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great
pain and difficulty which increased daily it was a consequence of his
hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke
very little but he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he
ought to hear 
being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after
the first day or so into the infirmary this gave me opportunities
of being with him that i could not otherwise have had and but for
his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a
determined prison breaker and i know not what else 
although i saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the
regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state i
do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better he
wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day
when the prison door closed upon him 
the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man
who was tired out i sometimes derived an impression from his manner
or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered
over the question whether he might have been a better man under better
circumstances but he never justified himself by a hint tending that
way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape 
it happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate
reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on
him a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with
a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small
redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child 
as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him
complain 
when the sessions came round mr jaggers caused an application to be
made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions it
was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long 
and was refused the trial came on at once and when he was put to the
bar he was seated in a chair no objection was made to my getting
close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he
stretched forth to me 
the trial was very short and very clear such things as could be said
for him were said how he had taken to industrious habits and had
thriven lawfully and reputably but nothing could unsay the fact that
he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury it was
impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty 
at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience
of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of
sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death 
but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me 
i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that i saw
two and thirty men and women put before the judge to receive that
sentence together foremost among the two and thirty was he seated 
that he might get breath enough to keep life in him 
the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment down
to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering in
the rays of april sun penned in the dock as i again stood outside it
at the corner with his hand in mine were the two and thirty men
and women some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and
weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about there
had been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been
stilled and a hush had succeeded the sheriffs with their great chains
and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great
gallery full of people a large theatrical audience looked on as the
two and thirty and the judge were solemnly confronted then the judge
addressed them among the wretched creatures before him whom he must
single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had
been an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments and
punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years 
and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his
escape and been re sentenced to exile for life that miserable man would
seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed
from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and
honest life but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and
passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to
society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had
come back to the country where he was proscribed being here presently
denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had
resisted them and had he best knew whether by express design or in
the blindness of his hardihood caused the death of his denouncer to
whom his whole career was known the appointed punishment for his return
to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this
aggravated case he must prepare himself to die 
the sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the
glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of
light between the two and thirty and the judge linking both together 
and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on 
with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all things 
and cannot err rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this
way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence
of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again 
there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say
to the rest then they were all formally doomed and some of them were
supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of
bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hands 
and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from
the sweet herbs lying about he went last of all because of having to
be helped from his chair and to go very slowly and he held my hand
while all the others were removed and while the audience got up
 putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and
pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me 
i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorder s
report was made but in the dread of his lingering on i began that
night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting
forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my
sake i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could and when i
had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men
in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the
crown itself for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took
no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed
in these appeals and after i had sent them in i could not keep away
from the places where they were but felt as if they were more
hopeful and less desperate when i was near them in this unreasonable
restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening 
wandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions to
the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty
spring night with their ranges of stern shut up mansions and their
long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association 
the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more
strictly kept seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention
of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down
at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was
willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my
designs nobody was hard with him or with me there was duty to be
done and it was done but not harshly the officer always gave me the
assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the
room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses 
 malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked always
joined in the same report 
as the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly
looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face
until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would
subside again sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then
he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to
understand his meaning very well 
the number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change
in him than i had seen yet his eyes were turned towards the door and
lighted up as i entered 
 dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed i thought you was late 
but i knowed you couldn t be that 
 it is just the time said i i waited for it at the gate 
 you always waits at the gate don t you dear boy 
 yes not to lose a moment of the time 
 thank ee dear boy thank ee god bless you you ve never deserted me 
dear boy 
i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once
meant to desert him 
 and what s the best of all he said you ve been more comfortable
alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone 
that s best of all 
he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty do what he would 
and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a
film came over the placid look at the white ceiling 
 are you in much pain to day 
 i don t complain of none dear boy 
 you never do complain 
he had spoken his last words he smiled and i understood his touch to
mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast i laid it
there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it 
the allotted time ran out while we were thus but looking round i
found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered 
 you needn t go yet i thanked him gratefully and asked might i
speak to him if he can hear me 
the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away the change 
though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid
look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me 
 dear magwitch i must tell you now at last you understand what i
say 
a gentle pressure on my hand 
 you had a child once whom you loved and lost 
a stronger pressure on my hand 
 she lived and found powerful friends she is living now she is a lady
and very beautiful and i love her 
with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my
yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips then 
he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying on
it the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and
his head dropped quietly on his breast 
mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men
who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better
words that i could say beside his bed than o lord be merciful to him
a sinner 
now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally
determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them at once i put bills
up in the windows for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and
began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs i ought
rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and
concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth
beyond the fact that i was falling very ill the late stress upon me had
enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away i knew that it
was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless
as to that 
for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the floor anywhere 
according as i happened to sink down with a heavy head and aching
limbs and no purpose and no power then there came one night which
appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror 
and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i
found i could not do so 
whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night 
groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there whether i had
two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror 
not knowing how i had got out of bed whether i had found myself
lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up
the stairs and that the lights were blown out whether i had been
inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning
of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making 
whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of
the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss
havisham was consuming within it these were things that i tried to
settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on
my bed but the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them 
disordering them all and it was through the vapor at last that i saw
two men looking at me 
 what do you want i asked starting i don t know you 
 well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the
shoulder this is a matter that you ll soon arrange i dare say but
you re arrested 
 what is the debt 
 hundred and twenty three pound fifteen six jeweller s account i
think 
 what is to be done 
 you had better come to my house said the man i keep a very nice
house 
i made some attempt to get up and dress myself when i next attended
to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me i
still lay there 
 you see my state said i i would come with you if i could but
indeed i am quite unable if you take me from here i think i shall die
by the way 
perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to
believe that i was better than i thought forasmuch as they hang in
my memory by only this one slender thread i don t know what they did 
except that they forbore to remove me 
that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that
i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i
confounded impossible existences with my own identity that i was a
brick in the house wall and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me that i was a steel beam of a
vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored
in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered
off that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own
remembrance and did in some sort know at the time that i sometimes
struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and
that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and
would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me
down i also knew at the time but above all i knew that there was a
constant tendency in all these people who when i was very ill would
present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face 
and would be much dilated in size above all i say i knew that there
was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to
settle down into the likeness of joe 
after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that
while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did
not change whoever came about me still settled down into joe i opened
my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside joe 
i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the window seat smoking
his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw joe i asked for cooling
drink and the dear hand that gave it me was joe s i sank back on
my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and
tenderly upon me was the face of joe 
at last one day i took courage and said is it joe 
and the dear old home voice answered which it air old chap 
 o joe you break my heart look angry at me joe strike me joe tell
me of my ingratitude don t be so good to me 
for joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and
put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him 
 which dear old pip old chap said joe you and me was ever friends 
and when you re well enough to go out for a ride what larks 
after which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards
me wiping his eyes and as my extreme weakness prevented me from
getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering o god
bless him o god bless this gentle christian man 
joe s eyes were red when i next found him beside me but i was holding
his hand and we both felt happy 
 how long dear joe 
 which you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old
chap 
 yes joe 
 it s the end of may pip to morrow is the first of june 
 and have you been here all that time dear joe 
 pretty nigh old chap for as i says to biddy when the news of your
being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and
being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of
walking and shoe leather but wealth were not a object on his part and
marriage were the great wish of his hart 
 it is so delightful to hear you joe but i interrupt you in what you
said to biddy 
 which it were said joe that how you might be amongst strangers and
that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a moment
might not prove unacceptabobble and biddy her word were go to him 
without loss of time that said joe summing up with his judicial
air were the word of biddy go to him biddy say without loss of
time in short i shouldn t greatly deceive you joe added after a
little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that
young woman were without a minute s loss of time 
there joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked
to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at
stated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that
i was to submit myself to all his orders so i kissed his hand and lay
quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it 
evidently biddy had taught joe to write as i lay in bed looking at him 
it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he set about his letter my bedstead divested of its
curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sitting room as
the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and
the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day at my own
writing table pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles 
joe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the
pen tray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his
sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow bar or sledgehammer it was
necessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow 
and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin and
when he did begin he made every down stroke so slowly that it might
have been six feet long while at every up stroke i could hear his pen
spluttering extensively he had a curious idea that the inkstand was
on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into
space and seemed quite satisfied with the result occasionally he was
tripped up by some orthographical stumbling block but on the whole
he got on very well indeed and when he had signed his name and had
removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with
his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the
effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there 
with unbounded satisfaction 
not to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to
talk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day he
shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered 
 is she dead joe 
 why you see old chap said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by way
of getting at it by degrees i wouldn t go so far as to say that for
that s a deal to say but she ain t 
 living joe 
 that s nigher where it is said joe she ain t living 
 did she linger long joe 
 arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you
was put to it a week said joe still determined on my account to
come at everything by degrees 
 dear joe have you heard what becomes of her property 
 well old chap said joe it do appear that she had settled the most
of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella but she had
wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the
accident leaving a cool four thousand to mr matthew pocket and why 
do you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand
unto him because of pip s account of him the said matthew i am told
by biddy that air the writing said joe repeating the legal turn as
if it did him infinite good account of him the said matthew and a
cool four thousand pip 
i never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature of
the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money more
to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool 
this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i
had done i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations
had any legacies 
 miss sarah said joe she have twenty five pound perannium fur to
buy pills on account of being bilious miss georgiana she have twenty
pound down mrs what s the name of them wild beasts with humps old
chap 
 camels said i wondering why he could possibly want to know 
joe nodded mrs camels by which i presently understood he meant
camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in
spirits when she wake up in the night 
the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give
me great confidence in joe s information and now said joe you
ain t that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one
additional shovelful to day old orlick he s been a bustin open a
dwelling ouse 
 whose said i 
 not i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterous said
joe apologetically still a englishman s ouse is his castle and
castles must not be busted cept when done in war time and wotsume er
the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart 
 is it pumblechook s house that has been broken into then 
 that s it pip said joe and they took his till and they took his
cash box and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles 
and they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him
up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out but he knowed
orlick and orlick s in the county jail 
by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation i was slow
to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe
stayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again 
for the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need 
that i was like a child in his hands he would sit and talk to me in the
old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive
protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the
days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that
was gone he did everything for me except the household work for which
he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on
his first arrival which i do assure you pip he would often say in
explanation of that liberty i found her a tapping the spare bed like
a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale 
which she would have tapped yourn next and draw d it off with you a
laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in
the soup tureen and wegetable dishes and the wine and spirits in your
wellington boots 
we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had
once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship and when the day
came and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up 
took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were
still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of
the wealth of his great nature 
and joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country 
where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass 
and sweet summer scents filled all the air the day happened to be
sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought
how it had grown and changed and how the little wild flowers had been
forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and
by night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning
and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed
there came like a check upon my peace but when i heard the sunday
bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt
that i was not nearly thankful enough that i was too weak yet to be
even that and i laid my head on joe s shoulder as i had laid it long
ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much
for my young senses 
more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used
to talk lying on the grass at the old battery there was no change
whatever in joe exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my
eyes still just as simply faithful and as simply right 
when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried me so
easily across the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful
christmas day when he had carried me over the marshes we had not yet
made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of
my late history he was acquainted with i was so doubtful of myself now 
and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i
ought to refer to it when he did not 
 have you heard joe i asked him that evening upon further
consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was 
 i heerd returned joe as it were not miss havisham old chap 
 did you hear who it was joe 
 well i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you
the bank notes at the jolly bargemen pip 
 so it was 
 astonishing said joe in the placidest way 
 did you hear that he was dead joe i presently asked with increasing
diffidence 
 which him as sent the bank notes pip 
 yes 
 i think said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather
evasively at the window seat as i did hear tell that how he were
something or another in a general way in that direction 
 did you hear anything of his circumstances joe 
 not partickler pip 
 if you would like to hear joe i was beginning when joe got up and
came to my sofa 
 lookee here old chap said joe bending over me ever the best of
friends ain t us pip 
i was ashamed to answer him 
 wery good then said joe as if i had answered that s all right 
that s agreed upon then why go into subjects old chap which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary there s subjects enough
as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones lord to think of your
poor sister and her rampages and don t you remember tickler 
 i do indeed joe 
 lookee here old chap said joe i done what i could to keep you
and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my
inclinations for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it
were not so much said joe in his favorite argumentative way that
she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that
she dropped into you always heavier for it i noticed that it ain t a
grab at a man s whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your
sister was quite welcome that ud put a man off from getting a little
child out of punishment but when that little child is dropped into
heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up
and says to himself where is the good as you are a doing i grant you
i see the arm says the man but i don t see the good i call upon
you sir therefore to pint out the good 
 the man says i observed as joe waited for me to speak 
 the man says joe assented is he right that man 
 dear joe he is always right 
 well old chap said joe then abide by your words if he s always
right which in general he s more likely wrong he s right when he says
this supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you
was a little child you kep it mostly because you know d as j gargery s
power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his
inclinations theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects biddy giv herself a
deal o trouble with me afore i left for i am almost awful dull as i
should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should
so put it both of which said joe quite charmed with his logical
arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say namely 
you mustn t go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your
wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets 
the delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and
kindness with which biddy who with her woman s wit had found me out so
soon had prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind but
whether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had
all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not
understand 
another thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to
develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension
of was this as i became stronger and better joe became a little less
easy with me in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear
fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names 
the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ears i too had
fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me but 
imperceptibly though i held by them fast joe s hold upon them began
to slacken and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to
understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was
all mine 
ah had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that
in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off had i given
joe s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got
stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better
loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away 
it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the
temple gardens leaning on joe s arm that i saw this change in him very
plainly we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the
river and i chanced to say as we got up 
 see joe i can walk quite strongly now you shall see me walk back by
myself 
 which do not overdo it pip said joe but i shall be happy fur to
see you able sir 
the last word grated on me but how could i remonstrate i walked no
further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be
weaker than i was and asked joe for his arm joe gave it me but was
thoughtful 
i for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing
change in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts that i
was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come
down to i do not seek to conceal but i hope my reluctance was not
quite an unworthy one he would want to help me out of his little
savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i
must not suffer him to do it 
it was a thoughtful evening with both of us but before we went to
bed i had resolved that i would wait over to morrow to morrow being
sunday and would begin my new course with the new week on monday
morning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this
last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts
 that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go
out to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever as i
cleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically
arrived at a resolution too 
we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and
then walked in the fields 
 i feel thankful that i have been ill joe i said 
 dear old pip old chap you re a most come round sir 
 it has been a memorable time for me joe 
 likeways for myself sir joe returned 
 we have had a time together joe that i can never forget there were
days once i know that i did for a while forget but i never shall
forget these 
 pip said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has
been larks and dear sir what have been betwixt us have been 
at night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done
all through my recovery he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well
as in the morning 
 yes dear joe quite 
 and are always a getting stronger old chap 
 yes dear joe steadily 
joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and
said in what i thought a husky voice good night 
when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of
my resolution to tell joe all without delay i would tell him before
breakfast i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him 
for it was the first day i had been up early i went to his room and
he was not there not only was he not there but his box was gone 
i hurried then to the breakfast table and on it found a letter these
were its brief contents 
 not wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear
pip and will do better without jo 
 p s ever the best of friends 
enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i
had been arrested down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my
creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite
recovered i had never dreamed of joe s having paid the money but joe
had paid it and the receipt was in his name 
what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and
there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance
with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved
secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts 
and had formed into a settled purpose 
the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how
humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost
all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in
my first unhappy time then i would say to her biddy i think you once
liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away
from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since 
if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with
all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like
a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need
of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier
of you that i was not much but a little and biddy it shall rest
with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with joe or whether i
shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether
we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which
i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer and now 
dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with
me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man
for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you 
such was my purpose after three days more of recovery i went down to
the old place to put it in execution and how i sped in it is all i have
left to tell 
the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down
to my native place and its neighborhood before i got there i found the
blue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a
great change in the boar s demeanour whereas the boar had cultivated
my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property 
the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of
property 
it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so
often made so easily the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom 
which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and
could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
post chaises up the yard but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the
quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom 
early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled
round by satis house there were printed bills on the gate and on bits
of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of
the household furniture and effects next week the house itself was to
be sold as old building materials and pulled down lot was marked in
whitewashed knock knee letters on the brew house lot on that part of
the main building which had been so long shut up other lots were marked
off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to
make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already stepping in for a moment at the open gate and
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no
business there i saw the auctioneer s clerk walking on the casks and
telling them off for the information of a catalogue compiler pen in
hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often
pushed along to the tune of old clem 
when i got back to my breakfast in the boar s coffee room i found mr 
pumblechook conversing with the landlord mr pumblechook not improved
in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and
addressed me in the following terms 
 young man i am sorry to see you brought low but what else could be
expected what else could be expected 
as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was
broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it 
 william said mr pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table 
and has it come to this has it come to this 
i frowningly sat down to my breakfast mr pumblechook stood over me and
poured out my tea before i could touch the teapot with the air of a
benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last 
 william said mr pumblechook mournfully put the salt on in
happier times addressing me i think you took sugar and did you take
milk you did sugar and milk william bring a watercress 
 thank you said i shortly but i don t eat watercresses 
 you don t eat em returned mr pumblechook sighing and nodding
his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall true 
the simple fruits of the earth no you needn t bring any william 
i went on with my breakfast and mr pumblechook continued to stand over
me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did 
 little more than skin and bone mused mr pumblechook aloud and yet
when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore
him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach 
this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i 
and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the
same fat five fingers 
 hah he went on handing me the bread and butter and air you a going
to joseph 
 in heaven s name said i firing in spite of myself what does it
matter to you where i am going leave that teapot alone 
it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook
the opportunity he wanted 
 yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in
question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot
alone you are right young man for once you are right i forgit myself
when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame 
exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated
by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers and yet said
pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at
arm s length this is him as i ever sported with in his days of happy
infancy tell me not it cannot be i tell you this is him 
a low murmur from the two replied the waiter appeared to be
particularly affected 
 this is him said pumblechook as i have rode in my shay cart this
is him as i have seen brought up by hand this is him untoe the sister
of which i was uncle by marriage as her name was georgiana m ria from
her own mother let him deny it if he can 
the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave
the case a black look 
 young man said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old
fashion you air a going to joseph what does it matter to me you
ask me where you air a going i say to you sir you air a going to
joseph 
the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that 
 now said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air
of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph here is squires of
the boar present known and respected in this town and here is william 
which his father s name was potkins if i do not deceive myself 
 you do not sir said william 
 in their presence pursued pumblechook i will tell you young
man what to say to joseph says you joseph i have this day seen
my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun s i will name no
names joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have
seen that man 
 i swear i don t see him here said i 
 say that likewise retorted pumblechook say you said that and even
joseph will probably betray surprise 
 there you quite mistake him said i i know better 
 says you pumblechook went on joseph i have seen that man and
that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice he knows your
character joseph and is well acquainted with your pig headedness and
ignorance and he knows my character joseph and he knows my want of
gratitoode yes joseph says you here pumblechook shook his head and
hand at me he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode 
he knows it joseph as none can you do not know it joseph having no
call to know it but that man do 
windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face
to talk thus to mine 
 says you joseph he gave me a little message which i will now
repeat it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of
providence he knowed that finger when he saw joseph and he saw it
plain it pinted out this writing joseph reward of ingratitoode to his
earliest benefactor and founder of fortun s but that man said he did
not repent of what he had done joseph not at all it was right to do
it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it
again 
 it s pity said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted breakfast 
 that the man did not say what he had done and would do again 
 squires of the boar pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and
william i have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down
town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to
do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it again 
with those words the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air 
and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by
the virtues of that same indefinite it i was not long after him in
leaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him
holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select
group who honored me with very unfavorable glances as i passed on the
opposite side of the way 
but it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to joe whose
great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be 
contrasted with this brazen pretender i went towards them slowly for
my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew
nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness
further and further behind 
the june weather was delicious the sky was blue the larks were soaring
high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more beautiful
and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet many pleasant
pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the change for the
better that would come over my character when i had a guiding spirit at
my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom i had proved beguiled
my way they awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened
by my return and such a change had come to pass that i felt like one
who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings
had lasted many years 
the schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen but the
little roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietness 
sake took me past it i was disappointed to find that the day was a
holiday no children were there and biddy s house was closed some
hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before
she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated 
but the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it under
the sweet green limes listening for the clink of joe s hammer long
after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i heard it
and found it but a fancy all was still the limes were there and the
white thorns were there and the chestnut trees were there and their
leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen but the clink of
joe s hammer was not in the midsummer wind 
almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i saw
it at last and saw that it was closed no gleam of fire no glittering
shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and still 
but the house was not deserted and the best parlor seemed to be in use 
for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window
was open and gay with flowers i went softly towards it meaning to peep
over the flowers when joe and biddy stood before me arm in arm 
at first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but
in another moment she was in my embrace i wept to see her and she wept
to see me i because she looked so fresh and pleasant she because i
looked so worn and white 
 but dear biddy how smart you are 
 yes dear pip 
 and joe how smart you are 
 yes dear old pip old chap 
i looked at both of them from one to the other and then 
 it s my wedding day cried biddy in a burst of happiness and i am
married to joe 
they had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on
the old deal table biddy held one of my hands to her lips and joe s
restoring touch was on my shoulder which he warn t strong enough my
dear fur to be surprised said joe and biddy said i ought to
have thought of it dear joe but i was too happy they were both so
overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to
them so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their day
complete 
my first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never breathed
this last baffled hope to joe how often while he was with me in my
illness had it risen to my lips how irrevocable would have been his
knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour 
 dear biddy said i you have the best husband in the whole world 
and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have but no you
couldn t love him better than you do 
 no i couldn t indeed said biddy 
 and dear joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will
make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble joe 
joe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before
his eyes 
 and joe and biddy both as you have been to church to day and are in
charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you
have done for me and all i have so ill repaid and when i say that i am
going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i shall
never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have kept me
out of prison and have sent it to you don t think dear joe and biddy 
that if i could repay it a thousand times over i suppose i could cancel
a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if i could 
they were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no
more 
 but i must say more dear joe i hope you will have children to love 
and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of a winter
night who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for
ever don t tell him joe that i was thankless don t tell him biddy 
that i was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that i honored you both 
because you were both so good and true and that as your child i said
it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i did 
 i ain t a going said joe from behind his sleeve to tell him
nothink o that natur pip nor biddy ain t nor yet no one ain t 
 and now though i know you have already done it in your own kind
hearts pray tell me both that you forgive me pray let me hear you
say the words that i may carry the sound of them away with me and then
i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of
me in the time to come 
 o dear old pip old chap said joe god knows as i forgive you if i
have anythink to forgive 
 amen and god knows i do echoed biddy 
 now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few
minutes by myself and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go
with me as far as the finger post dear joe and biddy before we say
good by 
 
i sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition
with my creditors who gave me ample time to pay them in full and i
went out and joined herbert within a month i had quitted england 
and within two months i was clerk to clarriker and co and within four
months i assumed my first undivided responsibility for the beam across
the parlor ceiling at mill pond bank had then ceased to tremble under
old bill barley s growls and was at peace and herbert had gone away to
marry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until
he brought her back 
many a year went round before i was a partner in the house but i lived
happily with herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my
debts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and joe it
was not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to
herbert but he then declared that the secret of herbert s partnership
had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it so he
told it and herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow
and i were not the worse friends for the long concealment i must not
leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we made
mints of money we were not in a grand way of business but we had a
good name and worked for our profits and did very well we owed so
much to herbert s ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often
wondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i
was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude
had never been in him at all but had been in me 
for eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily
eyes though they had both been often before my fancy in the
east when upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i
laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door i touched it
so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen there smoking his
pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as
ever though a little gray sat joe and there fenced into the corner
with joe s leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire 
was i again 
 we giv him the name of pip for your sake dear old chap said joe 
delighted when i took another stool by the child s side but i did not
rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and
we think he do 
i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we
talked immensely understanding one another to perfection and i took
him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there 
and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife
of the above 
 biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl
lay sleeping in her lap you must give pip to me one of these days or
lend him at all events 
 no no said biddy gently you must marry 
 so herbert and clara say but i don t think i shall biddy i have so
settled down in their home that it s not at all likely i am already
quite an old bachelor 
biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and
then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine 
there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddy s
wedding ring that had a very pretty eloquence in it 
 dear pip said biddy you are sure you don t fret for her 
 o no i think not biddy 
 tell me as an old old friend have you quite forgotten her 
 my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
foremost place there and little that ever had any place there but that
poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddy all gone
by 
nevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly intended
to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake 
yes even so for estella s sake 
i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being
separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who
had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality 
and meanness and i had heard of the death of her husband from an
accident consequent on his ill treatment of a horse this release had
befallen her some two years before for anything i knew she was married
again 
the early dinner hour at joe s left me abundance of time without
hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark 
but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
of old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place 
there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the
wall of the old garden the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough
fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck
root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin a gate in
the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in 
a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet
up to scatter it but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the
moon was coming and the evening was not dark i could trace out where
every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been 
and where the gates and where the casks i had done so and was looking
along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it 
the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced it had been moving
towards me but it stood still as i drew nearer i saw it to be the
figure of a woman as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when
it stopped and let me come up with it then it faltered as if much
surprised and uttered my name and i cried out 
 estella 
 i am greatly changed i wonder you know me 
the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained those attractions in it 
i had seen before what i had never seen before was the saddened 
softened light of the once proud eyes what i had never felt before was
the friendly touch of the once insensible hand 
we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many years 
it is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our
first meeting was do you often come back 
 i have never been here since 
 nor i 
the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white
ceiling which had passed away the moon began to rise and i thought of
the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last words he had heard on
earth 
estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us 
 i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been
prevented by many circumstances poor poor old place 
the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and
the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes not knowing
that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said
quietly 
 were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this
condition 
 yes estella 
 the ground belongs to me it is the only possession i have not
relinquished everything else has gone from me little by little but i
have kept this it was the subject of the only determined resistance i
made in all the wretched years 
 is it to be built on 
 at last it is i came here to take leave of it before its change and
you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer you
live abroad still 
 still 
 and do well i am sure 
 i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and therefore yes i do
well 
 i have often thought of you said estella 
 have you 
 of late very often there was a long hard time when i kept far from me
the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant
of its worth but since my duty has not been incompatible with the
admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart 
 you have always held your place in my heart i answered 
and we were silent again until she spoke 
 i little thought said estella that i should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot i am very glad to do so 
 glad to part again estella to me parting is a painful thing to me 
the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful 
 but you said to me returned estella very earnestly god bless you 
god forgive you and if you could say that to me then you will not
hesitate to say that to me now now when suffering has been stronger
than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart
used to be i have been bent and broken but i hope into a better
shape be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are
friends 
 we are friends said i rising and bending over her as she rose from
the bench 
 and will continue friends apart said estella 
i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as
the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the
evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil
light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her
